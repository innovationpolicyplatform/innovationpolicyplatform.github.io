Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance.

The OECD Patent Database fully covers patent applications to the European Patent Office (EPO) (from 1978 onwards); patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (from 1976 onwards); patents filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT), at international phase, that designate the EPO (from 1978 onwards); patents that belong to Triadic Patent Families (OECD definition): i.e. sub-set of patents all filed together at the EPO, at the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) and granted by the USPTO, protecting the same set of inventions.<br /><br />The <em>OECD Patent Statistics Manual</em> (2009) capitalises on experience on patent statistics and promote the harmonisation of methodologies. It addresses issues regarding the complexity of patent data and provide statisticians and analysts with guidelines for building and analysing patent-related indicators.<br /><br />PCT patent counts are based on data received from the EPO (EPO Bibliographic database). Patent data are presented according to various dates (all based on calendar years). OECD patent indicators are aimed to provide a measure of the S&T output, therefore, there are usually published according to the priority date, which is the closest to the date of invention.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Cross-border ownership of patents reflects international flows of knowledge from the inventor country to the applicant countries and international flows of funds for research (multinational companies).
