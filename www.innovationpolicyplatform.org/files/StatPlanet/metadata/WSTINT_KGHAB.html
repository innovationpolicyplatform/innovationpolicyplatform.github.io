Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance.

Data are provided by Member countries' authorities through the OECD/Eurostat questionnaire on the state of the environment. Selected updates were also done in the context of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/env/country-reviews/reviewingenvironmentalperformance.htm">OECD Environmental Performance Reviews</a>. The data are harmonised through the work of the OECD Working Party on Environmental Information (WPEI). In many countries systematic collection of environmental data has a short history; sources are typically spread across a range of agencies and levels of government, and information is often collected for other purposes. When interpreting these data, one should  keep in mind that definitions and measurement methods vary among countries, and that inter-country comparisons require careful interpretation. One should also note that data presented here refer to national level and may conceal major subnational differences.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>OECD, Municipal Waste Countries’ Metadata: OECD Member Countries, OECD Environment Directorate, <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/wbos/fileview2.aspx?IDFile=9bc27df8-1205-468c-b178-ce0d200f2641">country notes</a>.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>2013</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed in kg per capita.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>34 OECD countries and Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russian Federation.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Recommended uses and limitations</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>IPP.Stat gathers data and metadata from various sources along criteria of STI policy relevance, international comparability and optimal country coverage.
