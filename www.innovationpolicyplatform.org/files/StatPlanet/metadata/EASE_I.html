The index uses a scale of zero to six to evaluate: i) complexity of regulatory procedures (e.g. licences and permits system, communication and simplification of rules and procedures); ii) administrative burdens on start-ups (e.g. administrative burdens for corporations and sole proprietor firms, barriers in services sector) and iii) regulatory protection of incumbents (e.g. legal barriers to entry, antitrust exemptions, barriers in network sectors). As lower values suggest lower barriers, the barriers to entrepreneurship index is reversed so as to be read in the same way as other indicators used in this international benchmark.<br /><br />The ease of entrepreneurship index is calculated as 6 minus the barriers to entrepreneurship index (Code indicator=BTE_I).
