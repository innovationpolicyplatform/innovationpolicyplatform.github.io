Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance. Data are provided back to the early 1980s.<br><br>See below recommendations on use and citations.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Direct source</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Data for this indicator are drawn from OECD calculations based on the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT), European Patent Office (EPO) and ECOOM-EUROSTAT-EPO PATSTAT Person Augmented Table (EEE-PPAT).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source Periodicity</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Occasional. Patents applications by universities and public research institutions cover the government sector, higher education and hospitals. They include patent applications filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT), by priority date and applicant’s country of residence. Patent applicant names are allocated to institutional sectors using a dataset developed by Eurostat and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL). Because there are important variations in the names recorded in patent documents, misallocations to sectors may occur and thus introduce biases in the resulting indicator.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'></font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT), EPO: Spring 2014.<br />ECOOM-EUROSTAT-EPO PATSTAT Person Augmented Table (EEE-PPAT): October 2013.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as a % of PCT patent applications filed in biotechnologies.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Global coverage.
