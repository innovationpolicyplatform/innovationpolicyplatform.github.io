The OECD Patent Database fully covers patent applications to the European Patent Office (EPO) (from 1978 onwards); patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (from 1976 onwards); patents filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT), at international phase, that designate the EPO (from 1978 onwards); patents that belong to Triadic Patent Families (OECD definition): i.e. sub-set of patents all filed together at the EPO, at the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) and granted by the USPTO, protecting the same set of inventions.<br /><br />The <em>OECD Patent Statistics Manual</em> (2009) capitalises on experience on patent statistics and promote the harmonisation of methodologies. It addresses issues regarding the complexity of patent data and provide statisticians and analysts with guidelines for building and analysing patent-related indicators. PCT patent counts are based on data received from the EPO (EPO Bibliographic database). Patent data are presented according to various dates (all based on calendar years). OECD patent indicators are aimed to provide a measure of the S&T output, therefore, there are usually published according to the priority date, which is the closest to the date of invention.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Patent counts by technology (including total patents, estimated total patents for latest years) -EPO, USPTO, PCT and Triadic Patent Families- are presented according to classes of the International Patent Classification (IPC class up to 4 characters) and for selected technology domains such as ICT, nanotechnology, biotechnology as well as environment-related and health-related technologies.<br /><br />OECD (2009), <em>OECD Patent Statistics Manual</em>, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/innovation/inno/oecdpatentstatisticsmanual.htm">www.oecd.org/innovation/inno/oecdpatentstatisticsmanual.htm</a>.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>March 2014.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed in full number.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Global coverage.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Classification(s) used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>International Patent Classification (IPC class up to 4 characters) </font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Recommended uses and limitations</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>IPP.Stat gathers data and metadata from various sources along criteria of STI policy relevance, international comparability and optimal country coverage.
