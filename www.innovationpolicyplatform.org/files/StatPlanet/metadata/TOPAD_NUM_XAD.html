The data collection for the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) took place from 1 August 2011 to 31 March 2012 in most participating countries. Around 166 000 adults, representing 724 million adults aged 16 to 65, were surveyed in the official language/s of the countries.  </font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>The Survey of Adult Skills define:<br />   - Literacy as “understanding, evaluating, using and engaging with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential”.<br />   - Numeracy as “the ability to access, use, interpret and communicate mathematical information and ideas, in order to engage in and manage the mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life”<br />   - Problem solving in technology-rich environments as “using digital technology, communication tools and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others and perform practical tasks”. It focuses on “the abilities to solve problems for personal, work and civic purposes by setting up appropriate goals and plans, and accessing and making use of information through computers and computer networks”. Problem solving in technology-rich environments represents the intersection of what are sometimes described as “computer literacy” skills (i.e. the capacity to use ICT tools and applications) and the cognitive skills required to solve problems.<br /><br />See OECD (2013), <em>The Survey of Adult Skills: Reader’s Companion</em>, OECD Publishing, Paris (<a href="http://skills.oecd.org/documents/Survey_of_Adult_Skills_Readers_Companion.pdf">pdf</a>).<br /><br />See also <a href="http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/country-specific-material.htm">country notes</a>.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'></font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as a % of 16-65 year-old adult population.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>24 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russian Federation, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England/N.
