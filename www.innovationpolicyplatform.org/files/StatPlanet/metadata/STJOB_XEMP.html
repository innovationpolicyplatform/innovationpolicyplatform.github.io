Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance.

Many countries maintain national classifications that are more detailed and may have different criteria for defining occupations. Converting national classifications to ISCO for comparative purposes may lead to a loss or distortion of information. As the process of adopting the new classification and developing appropriate conversion tables is still under way, the scope for cross-country and longitudinal comparisons is currently reduced.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Human resources in science and technology (HRST) are defined in the Canberra Manual (OECD and Eurostat, 1995) as persons graduated at the tertiary level of education or employed in a science and technology occupation for which a high qualification is normally required and innovation potential is high.
