Data are derived from the UN Global E-Readiness Reports and the E-Government Surveys which are produced by the Division for Public Administration and Development Management (DPADM) of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). The DPADM publishes the UN E-Government Survey every two years. The Survey assesses the e-government readiness and extent of e-participation of the UN Member States according to a quantitative composite index of e-readiness based on website assessment, telecommunication infrastructure, and human resource endowment. The Survey serves as a tool for decision-makers to identify their strengths and challenges in the area of e-government development.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>E-government is defined as the use of ICTs to more effectively and efficiently deliver government services to citizens and businesses.<br /><br />UN E-Government Survey <a href="http://unpan3.un.org/egovkb/en-us/About/Methodology">Methodology</a>.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>2014</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as an index (see source metadata for further explanations).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Global coverage.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Recommended uses and limitations</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>IPP.Stat gathers data and metadata from various sources along criteria of STI policy relevance, international comparability and optimal country coverage.
