Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance.

For the United States, EU members and Japan, counts exclude applications in their domestic market (USPTO, OHIM and JPO, respectively). Counts are rescaled by taking into account the relative average propensity of other countries to file in these three offices.<br /><br />See Graham, S. et al.
