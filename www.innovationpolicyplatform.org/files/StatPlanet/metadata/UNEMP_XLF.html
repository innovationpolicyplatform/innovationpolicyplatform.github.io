The “ALFS Summary tables” dataset is a subset of the Annual Labour Force Statistics database which presents annual labour force statistics and broad population series. Euro area and EU data were extracted from Eurostat (LFS Series, Detailed annual survey results). Annual employment statistics use three sources: Labour force survey, business statistics results or administrative sources such as Social Security records. They may differ from annual employment statistics published in the OECD National Accounts where employment series have undergone transformation to meet the requirements of the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). These estimates are primarily used for labour input purposes, e.g. for productivity calculations.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>The total labour force, or currently active population, comprises all persons who fulfill the requirements for inclusion among the employed or the unemployed. The Civilian Labour Force corresponds to Total Labour Force excluding armed forces. Persons in employment (civilian employment plus the armed forces) include all those employed, paid at work or not, self-employed, unpaid family workers, persons temporarily not at work because of illness or injury, holiday or vacation, strike or lock-out, educational/training leave, or other leave. The unemployed comprise all persons, who during the reference period were without work, i.e. were not in paid employment or self-employment, currently available for work and seeking work. Unemployment rate is defined as the ratio between the number of unemployed and the total labour force. The employment rate represents persons in employment as a percentage of the working age population, i.e. persons aged 15-64.<br /><br />ILO/OECD Definitions of Labour Force statistics (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/employment/labour-stats/2771299.pdf">pdf</a>).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>September 2014.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as a % of total civilian labour force.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>34 OECD countries, Brazil, Colombia, Russian Federation and 4 geographical areas (Major Seven, Euro area, EU total and OECD total).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Recommended uses and limitations</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>IPP.Stat gathers data and metadata from various sources along criteria of STI policy relevance, international comparability and optimal country coverage.
