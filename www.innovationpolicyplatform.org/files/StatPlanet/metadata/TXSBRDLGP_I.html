(2001), “Measuring the value of R&D tax treatments in OECD countries”, STI Review No. 27: Special Issue on New Science and Technology Indicators, OECD Publishing, Paris (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/37124998.pdf">pdf</a>).<br /><br />The B-index traditionally assumes that the “representative firm” is taxable and enjoys the incentive’s full benefit. The B-index for the profit scenario assumes that the “representative firm” generates a sufficiently large profit to achieve the incentive’s full potential benefit. An adjusted B-index is reported for a firm unable to claim tax benefits in the reporting period. When credits or allowances are fully refundable, the B-index of a company in such position is identical to the profit scenario. Carry-forwards are modelled as discounted options to claim the incentive in the future, assuming a constant annual probability of returning to profit of 50% and a nominal discount rate of 10%. For simplicity, loss-making firms are assumed to enjoy an infinite carry-forward of standard deductions of current R&D expenditures and depreciation expenses arising from the use of machinery, equipment and buildings in R&D, unless expenditures are refundable.
