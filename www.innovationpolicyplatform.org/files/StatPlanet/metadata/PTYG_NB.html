Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance.

Young firms are defined as firms less than five years old with an incorporation date in business registers (ORBIS©) between 2004 and 2011. Patenting firms are those filing patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO), at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) between 2008 and 2011.<br /><br />It should be stressed that this experimental indicator is obtained by matching patent (EPO/USPTO/PCT patent filings) and business (listed in the ORBIS database) data: the names of applicants as they appear in the patent were linked with those of firms listed in business registers. Counts are limited to a set of patent applicants which have been successfully matched with business register data. In addition, only countries with average matching rates over 70% over the period are included.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'></font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>June 2013 (no new revision planned).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed in full number.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Global coverage.
