Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance. Data are provided back to the early 1980s.<br><br>See below recommendations on use and citations.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Direct source</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Data for this indicator are drawn from OECD Income Distribution and Poverty Database (IDD), <a href="http://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm">www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm</a>.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source Periodicity</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Annual. Standardised indicators based on the central concept of “equivalised household disposable income”, i.e. the total income received by the households less the current taxes and transfers they pay, adjusted for household size with an equivalence scale. Income distribution has a long-standing tradition among household-level statistics, with regular data collections going back to the 1980s (and sometimes earlier) in many OECD countries. The IDD data collection and compilation process is based on a common set of statistical conventions (e.g. on income concepts and components) and the information is obtained by the OECD through a network of national data providers, via a standardized questionnaire, based on national sources.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Source metadata</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>The data for certain countries includes one or more breaks in series. The reasons for these breaks are varied and include the switch to a different survey, different methodology (switch from tax units to households in Sweden) or population coverage (Germany). Because pre- and post-break data are usually not comparable, it has been decided to present them separately in the original IDD database. The series based on the current definition are presented in the IPP.Stat.<br /><br />Two indicators of income inequality (i,ii) and one indicator of poverty (iii) are included in the IPP.Stat.<br />  i) The Gini coefficient is based on the comparison of cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of income they receive, and it ranges between 0 in the case of perfect equality and 1 in the case of perfect inequality.<br />  ii) The S90/S10 ratio is the share of all income received by the top decile (i.e. the 10% of people with highest income) divided by the share of the first, or the ratio of the average income of the top decile to that of the first.<br />  iii) Poverty rate (50%): people are counted as poor “after taxes and transfers” when their market income is lower or equal to 50% of the median disposable income.<br /><br />See country metadata (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/IDD-Metadata.pdf">pdf</a>).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>June 2014.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as an index (see source metadata for further explanations).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>34 OECD countries.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Recommended uses and limitations</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>IPP.Stat gathers data and metadata from various sources along criteria of STI policy relevance, international comparability and optimal country coverage.
