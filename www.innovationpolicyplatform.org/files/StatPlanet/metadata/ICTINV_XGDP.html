Data are drawn from OECD official databases and equivalent in international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Bank etc.), as well as from international sources of relevance.

Software includes acquisition of pre-packaged software, customised software and software developed in-house. As ICT products, in particular software, are often included as intermediates to non-ICT capital goods, estimates of investment in ICT may understate the importance of ICTs to overall investment.<br /><br />Some care is needed when comparing investment in software acros countries and years, as levels may be affected by the degree to which software is bundled with other products (e.g. ICT equipment).</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>June 2014.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as a % of GDP</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Classification(s) used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'><a href="http://www.oecd.org/std/na/thesystemofnationalaccounts1993--glossary.htm">1993 System of National Accounts</a> (SNA).
