Estimates reported here exclude income-based incentives – preferential treatment of incomes from licensing or asset disposal attributable to R&D or patents (e.g. patent box) – and incentives to taxpayers other than companies (e.g. researchers). Figures refer to incentives applied at a national level through corporate income taxes, employer social security contributions and withholding taxes for R&D personnel. Personal and consumption tax incentives are not included.
