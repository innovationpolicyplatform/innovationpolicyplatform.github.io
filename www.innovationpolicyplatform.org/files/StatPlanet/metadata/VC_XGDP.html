In the <em>OECD Entrepreneurship Financing Database</em>, venture capital comprises the sum of early stage (including pre-seed, seed, start-up and other early stage) and later stage venture capital. As there are no internationally harmonised definitions of venture capital stages across venture capital associations and other data providers, original data have been re-aggregated to fit the OECD classification of venture capital by stages.<br /><br />OECD (2014), “International comparability of venture capital data”, in <em>Entrepreneurship at a Glance 2014</em>, OECD Publishing, Paris, accessible on the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/entrepreneur_aag-2014-30-en">OECD iLibrary</a>.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Date last input received</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>August 2014.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Unit of measure used</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Expressed as a % of GDP</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Geographic coverage </b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.</font><br><br><font SIZE='11' COLOR='#000066'><b>Recommended uses and limitations</b></font><br><br><font SIZE='9'>IPP.Stat gathers data and metadata from various sources along criteria of STI policy relevance, international comparability and optimal country coverage.
