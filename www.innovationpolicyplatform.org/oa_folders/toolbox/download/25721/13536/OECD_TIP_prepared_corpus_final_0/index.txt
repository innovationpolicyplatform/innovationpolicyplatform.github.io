DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)1	BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THE TIP WORKSHOP ON INNOVATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT	2000	R	1. It is now widely accepted that innovation can play a crucial role in contributing to the environmental sustainability of growth. This is because environmental sustainability requires radical changes in the nature of goods and services that are produced as well as the way they are produced, distributed and used. Despite its the recognition of this crucial role, it is not clear however under what conditions innovations for environmental sustainability are stimulated. Because of the externalities involved in their development and diffusion, it is clear that environmental innovations suffer from market failure. Also, because of the complex nature of environmental innovations that require trans-disciplinary and inter-sectoral approach to problem solving and the generation of relevant process and product innovations including organisational innovations, innovations for environmental sustainability suffer from systemic failure. 2. There are a number of obstacles in formulating effective policies to address these market and systemic failures. One is the diffuse nature that characterises environmental technology or innovation. Any technology can become environmental technology when applied with the objective of enhancing environmental performance. Many innovations in other areas such as energy, for example, have significant environmental impacts. Structural changes in the economy resulting from the diffusion of ICTs also have environmental impacts by reducing the demand and production of polluting goods and services. Also, the ongoing shift from the predominance of end-of-pipe techniques to cleaner technologies further add to the diffuse nature of environmental innovations, and the consequent difficulty in defining the boundaries of both environmental Research and Development and environmental goods and services industry. 3. These characteristics of environmental innovation make it difficult for firms to formulate corporate strategies to enhance environmental performance. For sometime, corporate responses have been defensive and reactive with minimal compliance to environmental regulations and general reluctance to internalise environmental issues. More recently, corporate attitude has become more proactive and positive with the realisation that enhancing environmental performance presents business opportunities, through the shift to cleaner technologies that enhance firm-level resource efficiency. This trend has given rise to the double dividend argument that environmental regulations can induce dynamic efficiency gains by the firm through innovation, but this has met with criticisms about the level of actual cost as well as the nature of the benefits gained. Lack of indicators and disaggregated data hinders drawing satisfactory lessons from this debate. In any case it is now widely viewed that the factors that drive firms to innovate environmentally make up a complex incentive structure, which encompass regulatory, commercial as well 1 . Some parts of this paper draw on the following recent paper: Fukasaku (2000).   as social awareness factors. Because of this, organisational innovations within the firm including re-orientation of Research and Development play an important part, and co-operative forms of action through networks of collaboration and learning both within and extending beyond the boundaries of the firm play a crucial role. 4. Because of the characteristics of environmental innovation and the complexity of the incentive structure that drive firms to innovate for environmental sustainability, it is not easy to design effective public policies to address the market and systemic failures involved. So far there has been a lack of coherence between environmental policies and innovation policies. The former had for long been largely based on technology specification and performance standards of the command and control type that stifled innovation or ignored cost effectiveness. This is giving way to the integration of more incentive- based instruments such as economic instruments and voluntary agreements that give more flexibility for firms. The transformation in the regulatory regime is facilitating the shift to cleaner technologies. Also experiences with some economic instruments, such as the tradable sulphur dioxide permits programme in the United States, indicate that this can induce cost-effective innovations on the part of the firms concerned. 5. The importance of Research and Development itself, and the need to re-orient Research and Development strategies, as well as the systemic failures involved, point to the crucial role of research and innovation policy to stimulate environmental innovations. Innovation policies had long ignored environmental sustainability because of its vague link to commercial interests. However, as the commercial value of environmental innovations is becoming clear, this trend is changing. The issues involved are leveraging Research and Development funding, promoting co-operative approaches, identifying potential future technologies and linking the research base with the market, and exploring the commercialisation of relevant technologies. These are being pursued through such instruments as PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, technology foresight, promotion of innovative clusters, and strategic niche management. Such active innovation policy instruments are necessary to overcome the systemic barriers in enhancing relevant research and innovation for environmental sustainability.	environmental sustainability *** environmental sustainability *** environmental sustainability *** environmental innovations *** development and diffusion *** market failures *** systemic failures *** environmental innovations *** organisational innovations *** innovative products *** environmental sustainability *** systemic failures *** environmental technologies *** environmental performance *** environmental technologies *** environmental innovations *** environmental innovations *** environmental performance *** environmental performance *** innovative firms *** incentive structures *** organisational innovations *** systemic failures *** environmental innovations *** incentive structures *** environmental sustainability *** environmental policy *** economic instruments *** economic instruments *** systemic failures *** development strategies *** environmental innovations *** environmental sustainability *** environmental innovations *** research base *** public private partnerships *** foresight exercises *** policy instruments *** environmental sustainability	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)10/REV1	PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE THEMATIC WORKSHOPS 2000-2001	2000	M	5 thematic topics are proposed for the 2 workshops to be held in 2000-2001: (1) Management of Intellectual Property generated from the Public Research Sector (key topics: The policies affecting the ownership of intellectual property; The issue of benefits to the country (rather than commercialization elsewhere); The management of intellectual property for the public good (e.g. national security, environmental, health concerns); Mechanisms for the transfer of technology (e.g. spin-offs, licensing of government-owned technology, collaborative agreements). (2) Growth and The Art of Policy Making in the Field of Science, Technology and Innovation (debating crucial factors: The proper positioning of the respective measure in the matrix of regional, national and international policies ; The potential of the respective public policy to interact with private decision making ; The leverage effects of STI-policies, particularly the way they might be interlinked with other policies (e.g. industry, environment, transport) ; The time factor). (3) Role of Competition and Co-operation in Innovation and Growth: The workshop would first examine the evidence on the linkages between competition, co-operation and innovation. This would include an analysis of the empirical evidence as regards the respective roles of competition and co-operation, which could be carried out based on a cross- country and/or sectoral basis drawing on indicators for competition, co-operation, and innovation. The workshop would also examine the existing policy approaches in this field across OECD member countries. (4) International Mobility of Researchers: Key issues to be addressed are whether the current international mobility patterns represent a systematic brain drain for some countries and regions and a  brain gain for others, or a circulation of knowledge flows. Another set of issues that could be explored is the regional and sectoral distribution of foreign Science and Technology personnel, as well as the incentives (pull and push factors) that drive international mobility. The workshop should thus also address the particular policies and regulations pertinent to international mobility of researchers, both those that give rise to (high or low) mobility in the first place and those that influence decisions to stay in the host country. (5) National Innovation Institutions and Support Systems  Best practices: The workshop could discuss the current structure of institutions for supporting innovation, the challenges for the future, co-operation within the system and the dissemination of good practices needed to increase and maintain the competitive strength of industry, including at the regional level. Consideration would also be given to the role of education and training; management and consulting; and technology transfer and support	intellectual property *** public research sector *** technology transfer *** innovation and growth *** policy approaches *** international mobility *** knowledge flows *** science and technology personnel *** international mobility *** host country *** international mobility *** regional level *** good practices *** support innovation *** best practices *** technology transfer	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)11	WORKSHOP ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FROM PUBLIC RESEARCH	2000	W2	The following is a short discussion paper that raises some of the main issues that experts and participants at the TIP Workshop should aim to address in order to help policy makers and public research institutions improve the management and commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs) from public research. (i) The Changes in National INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT Regimes. In many OECD countries, universities and research institutions in the public sector are establishing new regulations and incentive structures to promote the development and exploitation of knowledge with commercial promise. At the same time, many governments are also establishing explicit policies or guidelines concerning intellectual property rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs) for the public research institutions. Finding the Right Balance: research mandates versus commercial goals. The shift to a greater emphasis on obtaining INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs has not been straightforward as public research institutions have multiple, and at times competing, objectives : knowledge production; education missions, addressing social, environmental, and health related issues; and commercial development. Also, the public research base is made up of a variety of actors who contribute to the creation, protection, and exploitation of intellectual property. Not all actors are unquestionably in favour of further strengthening commercialisation policies. (ii) Economic scpillovers: By encouraging public research institutions to obtain and exploit IP rights, some observers fear that the contribution of public research to public goods  related to health, the environment, even national safety  is being jeopardised. Do governments need to take measures to ensure that innovations with a public good character are both developed and broadly diffused? If so, what types of measures  are relevant? National clauses: Some countries have tried to encourage the exploitation of publicly funded Research and Development domestically by including a national use clause. How can these clauses be implemented and enforce? Can their effectiveness be evaluated? Exclusive v. non-exclusive licensing: On the one hand, there is debate about whether exclusive licenses should be granted to discoveries that have benefited from public funds because such licenses can limit the diffusion of technologies. On the other hand, evidence shows that new start-ups and spin-off firms often require exclusive licensing. What are the costs and benefits of exclusive vs. non-exclusive licenses and on what basis do research institutions decide what type of agreement to negotiate? Mandatory licensing: Governments or public research institutions may require mandatory non- exclusive licensing of inventions from public research in order to ensure diffusion of research or to foster technological development through a competitive process. When has it been necessary to force non- exclusive licensing for national security, public health, or environmental reasons? Who does the mandating? (iii) Conflict Management: Secrecy, Tensions among disciplines, Changing the research agenda, Public outcries, Ownership of downstream IP. (iv) Institution Building: Protecting and commercialising public research requires effective institutional structures. What should be the role of national governments in helping research institutions build the types of support structures necessary for the protection and exploitation of their knowledge base? What kind of support measures should national governments provide to help public research institutions commercialise knowledge? (v) Economic outcomes: There are several indicators that can be used to show the relationship between INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT strategies and broader economic impacts such as the broader diffusion of research, greater economic relevance of research, the generation of revenue. Generally these indicators are derived from patent data, licensing data, and information on university/public research spin-off companies. These include: Patent application and obtention rates, Patent quality indicators, Patent citations, Licenses negotiated, Licensing and royalty revenues actualized, Spin-off creations. What is the evidence linking increased public sector patenting (or co-patenting) activities to economic growth for regional or national economies? Are individual firms in individual sectors relying more on IP outsourced from public research than in the past, and does this contribute their competitiveness?	intellectual property *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** public sector *** incentive structures *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** public research *** research base *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** funded research *** technology diffusion *** research organisations *** technology development *** research organisations *** public research *** research organisations *** knowledge base *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** economic impacts *** public research *** public sector *** economic growth *** public research *** public research *** intellectual property	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)12	ROLE OF COMPETITION AND CO-OPERATION IN INNOVATION AND GROWTH	2000	R	1. This paper explores the role of competition and co-operation in the context of innovation policy for economic growth. It examines their respective roles based on a survey of the existing literature and analyses the impact that recent technological changes have in this policy area. It also tries to offer some policy implications and suggests possible future directions of this work. 2. Rivalry among firms is commonly regarded as a driving force behind innovation. Empirical evidences suggest that competition could stimulate innovation and consequently contribute to economic growth. As economic history shows, however, sharper competition may also lead to the development of monopolistic market structures. 3. Co-operation among firms could also encourage innovation. An empirical survey confirms that various knowledge sources outside the boundary of an independent firm has a significant importance for the firm to develop innovation and expand its innovative potential. Theoretical studies also suggest that co-operative networks could be the most favourable arrangements, especially for radical innovation that requires the combination of more diverse knowledge sets than incremental innovation. Furthermore, some types of co-operation can have a significant effect on public welfare, as well as on competitive advantages of individual participating firms. 4. In recent years, new trends and challenges have emerged in OECD economies that are affecting the dynamics of innovation and the respective roles of competition and co-operation. A new strong monopolistic tendency in some high-tech industries (the information industry in particular) is one of the major challenges among them. Due to strong network effects on the demand side and economies of scale on the supply side, these industries tend to increase market concentration that attracts a keen attention from the antitrust authorities. In this context, the question in this policy area may be how to promote competition against these monopolistic tendencies. 5. Growing demand for co-operation is another trend that has become apparent in new high-tech industries. The innovation system in such industries is shifting toward more complex and socially distributed linkages of knowledge production activities, and co-operation with other firms has become an essential part of firms innovative effort. In such industries, traditional competition policy based on static short-run perspective may prevent co-operation among competitors that could not only increase their private profits but also enhance social welfare in the long run. At the same time, however, the role of competition will change dynamically as innovation advances and industry evolves. The policy issue in this respect might be how to apply dynamic long-run perspective to promote co-operation. 6. The policy issues raised by this analysis require further consideration. Due to the complex nature of recent OECD economies, it is almost impossible to understand in detail the process of innovation and industry evolution. Policy must therefore be prepared without knowing exactly what is going on and what will work. Under these circumstances, it should be helpful to have theoretical models that could give us policy implication. Further study may therefore be needed to survey and examine economic models in this policy field, as well as empirical evidences that could provide useful information to improve the accuracy of those models. In this respect, experiences from existing policy approaches across OECD Member countries might give some basic information, which is useful to formulate policy guidelines towards the better balance between competition and co-operation.	economic growth *** policy areas *** economic growth *** demand-side policies *** policy areas *** innovative firms *** innovation systems *** competition policy *** innovation process *** industrial innovation *** policy approaches *** innovation and growth	objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** other_policy_areas *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)13	NEW POLICIES FOR A NEW ECONOMY: EMERGING ISSUES IN PUBLIC FUNDING FOR Research and Development	2000	R	1. Public support for research and development (Research and Development) is a recognised tool for governments to use in promoting knowledge creation, technological innovation, and economic growth. Public funding for Research and Development totalled USD 160 billion across the OECD in 1998, representing 30% of all Research and Development expenditures within the region. Such funding is seen as a necessary means of ensuring that government missions are accomplished (e.g. national defence, environmental protection, health care) and of compensating for market failures that limit private investments in Research and Development, especially in more fundamental research.1 As such, public funding supports long-term, fundamental research2 to develop a knowledge base for subsequent exploitation and finances industrial Research and Development to more directly spur innovation and achieve social benefits, such as economic growth. 2. Previous OECD work has identified a continuing need for governments to fund high-risk Research and Development in order to fuel economic growth (OECD 2000a), but additional analysis is needed to understand how that support can best be provided to stimulate growth in the so-called new economy. New policies for public Research and Development funding will need to respond to several factors, including:  The ongoing transition to knowledge-based economies throughout the OECD, which emphasises the need for continuing investments in Research and Development and highlights the importance of particular industry sectors.  Changes in the nature of industrial Research and Development, including increased industry investments in Research and Development, a possible shift in business Research and Development toward more applied research, and the more pronounced role of small and medium sized enterprises in funding and conducting Research and Development.  The stronger links being forged between industry and public research institutions.  The emergence of important new industry sectors, such as information and communications technology (ICT) and biotechnology, that have significant direct and indirect economic effects. 3. These changes in the innovation environment suggest that a more nuanced set of policies for publicly financed Research and Development will be needed. Lingering questions about retaining national benefits in an era of 1 . Because firms cannot fully appropriate the returns from their Research and Development investments and prevent their competitors from capitalising on information spill-overs, private returns to Research and Development investment are less than the social returns, and firms tend to under-invest in Research and Development. 2 . The term fundamental research is used in this paper to refer to scientific and technological research that seeks to understand the underlying causes of phenomena and general principles. It is related to basic research but also encompasses work that is motivated by practical applications.   increasing globalisation (of both industry and the research community) and the proper balance between direct subsidisation of industrial Research and Development and indirect financial support (e.g. through tax credits) must also be resolved. 4. Although governments have a number of closely linked policy instruments for supporting Research and Development (e.g. providing research infrastructure, training workers),3 this paper focuses exclusively on the financing of Research and Development. It identifies current issues related to public support for Research and Development and the different mechanisms for providing it and examines them in the context of overall policies for science and technology. Representative issues considered include:  Levels of public funding for Research and Development: What levels  if any  of public funding for Research and Development are needed to boost innovation and economic growth? Must certain threshold levels of government funding be met in order to induce industrial innovation? How do levels of public Research and Development funding correlate with private-sector support for Research and Development? What overall trends are emerging in public funding for Research and Development and how do OECD countries differ in their support for Research and Development? How are changing government policies for supporting Research and Development in OECD countries likely to affect the innovation process?  Public funding for Research and Development in a knowledge-based economy: How does the emergence of a knowledge-based economy change the context in which public Research and Development support is provided? How can public support for Research and Development be formulated to most effectively contribute to innovation in the new economy?  Changing Nature of Industrial Innovation: How can public funding of Research and Development adapt to ongoing changes in the nature and structure of industry investments in Research and Development to best ensure that it plays a supportive, complementary role in driving innovation and economic growth?  Mechanisms for funding Research and Development: What mechanisms are most effective for providing public support for Research and Development? What are the relative merits of different approaches, such as funding for public research conducted in university and government labs, direct funding of industrial research, and indirect support for Research and Development through tax credits and other mechanisms? Are new mechanisms needed to support new areas of innovation or to strengthen Public Private Partnerships? Are there best practices that can be shared among member countries to promote economic growth? 5. The paper is intended to stimulate discussion among members of the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) and delegates to the OECD Committee on chabadi chabado. It will form the basis for a more in-depth analysis of public support for Research and Development to be presented to these groups at future meetings and will comprise one component of the chabadi chabado Divisions contribution to the OECDs horizontal project on growth. Members of the TIP are invited to comment on the draft and to suggest directions for further research or areas for particular emphasis.	support research *** economic growth *** research and development expenditures *** health care *** economic growth *** knowledge base *** fundamental research *** research investments *** research and development activities *** market failures *** economic growth *** public research and development *** research investments *** business sector *** knowledge-based economy *** business research and development *** applied research *** research investments *** research and development activities *** research organisations *** business sector *** research and development expenditures *** fundamental research *** basic research *** research and development activities *** tax incentives *** policy instruments *** supporting research and development *** support research *** economic growth *** industrial innovation *** support research *** public research and development *** support research *** innovation process *** supporting research and development *** public research and development *** knowledge-based economy *** supporting research and development *** support research *** economic growth *** industrial innovation *** research investments *** funded research *** support research *** support research *** public research *** tax incentives *** public private partnerships *** economic growth *** best practices *** support research	objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)14	MAIN LESSONS FROM THE BERLIN MEETINGS	2000	W2	The conference addressed the following main questions: How can the public research sector adapt to the emerging entrepreneurial model of research and innovation? How can the stakeholders  governments, public research institutions and industry  ensure that the knowledge that results from collaboration contributes to both economic and societal objectives? How can governments, universities and industry grow the human capital necessary for sustaining research and innovation in a context of increasing global competition for talent? Among the participants there was broad agreement on the following: Industry-science relationships are a pillar of the new economy. The exceptional economic performance of the United States in recent years underscores the role of efficient  interactions between business and public research in transforming knowledge into innovation, which is a key driver of economic growth. Strong relations between business and universities are also critical for countries to be able to attract and retain research talent. Research and commercialisation goals are not only compatible but can re-enforce one another. Countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Australia and France have made recent progress in achieving greater commercialisation from public research but many other countries continue to lag in reforming rules and creating incentives for commercialisation. There is also no single model for commercialising research but common rules are needed. Publicly funded research organisations (universities and public laboratories) and industry are best placed to determine how in practice their collaboration can be enhanced. Governments have the responsibility for setting the basic rules that reflect the public interest but provide the right incentives to both firms and public researchers and organisations. Despite international differences in the organisation and intensity of industry-science relationships, the Conference identified good practices and highlighted priorities for action for all countries. To balance opportunities and risks, conference participants agreed that policy action is especially important in five areas. (i) Ensuring appropriate intellectual property rights frameworks. Governments must establish clear rules and guidelines with regard to the intellectual property resulting from publicly funded research while granting sufficient autonomy to research institutions. A good practice is to grant intellectual property rights to the performing research organisation while ensuring that individual researchers  or research teams can share in the rewards. Globalisation of research accentuates the need for additional efforts to harmonise INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs regimes and practices at international level. (ii) Safeguarding public knowledge. Setting clear rules about INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs is key but not sufficient in order to achieve a balance between commercial aims and the research and teaching missions of public research institutions. Governments must ensure sufficient public access to knowledge from  publicly funded research. It must also acknowledge the risks to the research and innovation system that may result if the IP protection granted is too strong. Finally, ethical guidelines for and by public research institutions are necessary to prevent or resolve conflicts of interest among the institutions and researchers involved in collaboration with industry. (iii) Promoting the participation of smaller firms. Young technology-based firms play a key role in linking science to markets. Governments rightly attach priority to encouraging spin-offs from public research to stimulate innovation. Spin-offs fill the gap between research results and new innovative products and services. They are also a tool for universities to broadly license technology. But there is also a case for public support and incentives to existing chabadu chabados and especially those in mature industries in order to help them link up with the science base and enhance innovation capacity. (iv) Attracting and retaining human resources. Strong demand for highly skilled personnel increasingly extends across borders, raising concern of a brain drain in some countries as the loss of one or two key individuals can be undermine research capabilities. For companies and research institutions, keeping talent requires investments in in-house training, career growth potential as well as excellent research working conditions. To attract students at university, graduate programmes must better integrate interdisciplinarity and contacts with industry in training and research. For governments, removing barriers and disincentives to mobility and flexibility in research employment are also essential. (v) Improving the evaluation of research. Evaluation of publicly funded research must evolve in response to the considerable expansion of the commercialisation activities of universities and public research institutes, and evaluation criteria must take into account that excellence in research and training of graduates has become, at least in some disciplines, more tied to applications in industry. The evaluation of researchers of many public institutions should be  reformed to  give more recognition of their contribution to commercialisation efforts. Generally, governments lack information and tools to monitor industry-science relationships and evaluate their efficiency. In this area national initiatives should be complemented by further efforts at international level to develop benchmarking indicators and methodologies.	public research sector *** research organisations *** industry-science relationships *** economic growth *** public research *** commercialisation of research *** public research *** funded research *** research organisations *** public research *** good practices *** industry-science relationships *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** funded research *** research organisations *** good practices *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** research performance *** intellectual property *** international level *** globalisation of research *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** funded research *** innovation systems *** research organisations *** technology based firms *** public research *** innovative products *** research results *** small and medium sized firms *** science base *** innovation capacity *** human resources *** research organisations *** evaluation of research *** funded research *** research organisations *** research organisations *** industry-science relationships *** international level	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)15	FOCUS GROUPS ON NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: REPORTS BY LEAD COUNTRIES	2000	R	1. Human mobility is important because it is generally considered as an important mechanism for continuously restructuring the economy by (re)allocating the human resources. There is competition for the competence on a regional, national and to an increasing degree also international level. Human mobility is only one of several mechanisms for the transfer and diffusion of innovative competence. Of special importance for the national innovation system is the interaction between the primarily research producing sectors like universities, public and private research institutes and the primarily research using sectors, both public and private. 2. Expected mobility for tenured employees at universities should generally be very low. But again a very high demand for specific skills from other sectors might result in high mobility rates for certain very specific groups of university employees, well known cases being ICT and law. From a public or semi-public research institute we should expect higher mobility rates than from the universities. 3. It is intuitive that very little mobility in general means stagnation, means less innovation, due too little inflow of new ideas and experience. On the other hand very high mobility makes the accumulation of knowledge difficult since it disrupts team-work, makes it harder to accumulate of knowledge. The conclusion is to avoid the extremes and have mobility within a certain range. 26. Governments are aware of the growing importance of co-operative networks. They have developed policies to facilitate the creation and efficient functioning of inter-firm networks. In general, such policies have not had a theoretical basis. Traditional theories of government intervention were not developed with networks in mind, and research on networks has paid little attention to policy. Research on innovation systems has recently emphasised networks, but has generally been vague about governments role. It is not enough to point to new types of failure in learning economies and argue that governments should do something about them, since problems do not automatically call for government intervention. Other solutions  via markets, corporate hierarchies, business associations  may be more effective in some cases. In particular, networking problems can sometimes be solved more efficiently by large firms (hierarchies) and business associations. 27. Due to the limited research on network-facilitating policies, policy makers today still have little information about: i) the conditions under which network arrangements are more efficient than alternative organisational solutions; ii) the types of problems or failures that typically occur when setting up and   operating networks; and iii) which of these problems can be resolved most efficiently by government. Practical network policies should also take account of the governments organisational capabilities for solving specific networking problems. 28. Many problems may need to be addressed before a network can be successfully established. The costs of setting up a network tend to fall primarily on the organisation actively promoting it. They stem from the process of finding the right partners, negotiating, creating behavioural rules for co-operation and building the necessary shared resources. However, the benefits of an efficient network tend to accrue to all of its members. Thus, network formation has a public good or externality problem; the private benefits from network formation may not cover the private costs, although social benefits are likely to do so. Firms will only engage in network formation when the private benefits of setting up a network exceed its private costs. Otherwise there may be room for efficiency-enhancing government intervention. However, business associations or other bodies (e.g. chambers of commerce) may still provide more efficient solutions. 29. Where governments have a role, it differs according to the stage of the networking process. The stages include: i) awareness of a networking possibility; ii) search for partners; iii) building trust and a shared knowledge base; iv) organising the network; v) ensuring complementary resources; and vi) active co-operation. In the final stages, governments do not have a role to play. They should not continue to support networks once they are established and their benefits are obvious to participants. At this stage, all participants should contribute their fair share. 68. The evidence underlines the value and legitimacy of interventions to address systemic as well as macroeconomic issues. Policy interventions, if well designed and applied, are able to influence the internal behavioural characteristics of firms. They can have a profound effect on firms innovative capacities and performance, and achieve sustained change. They can have impacts at all levels, from the individual firm up to the overall national innovation system, and explicit objectives for all relevant levels and stakeholders should be articulated. 69. The context and circumstances of the individual firm do affect what policy support is most helpful  many interventions will have to include firm-specific elements. In practice, that means devolving a lot of discretion and authority to local business advisors who then have the flexibility to assist firms using the most appropriate approach and tools for the job, within an overall guiding framework. Taster interventions can raise firms awareness and overcome reluctance to use such help. Flexibility at the regional level is also important, since different types of policy intervention suit different regional innovation systems as well as different types of firm. 70. A significant implication of our work is that Governments should consider shifting the balance of resources towards a greater emphasis on diffusion and extension programmes. Past evaluations of diffusion programmes can be unduly pessimistic, as evaluations are based primarily on efficiency in a narrow sense while omitting less tangible impacts on culture, competence and learning.	human resources *** international level *** business research and development *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** public research *** research organisations *** innovation systems *** knowledge base *** policy interventions *** innovation capacity *** innovative firms *** national innovation systems *** policy interventions *** innovation systems *** regional level *** diffusion programmes *** national innovation systems	policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)16	FOCUS GROUPS ON NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: DRAFT FINAL REPORT Knowledge Markets and Innovation Systems: Nurturing the Institutions of Innovation	2000	R	1. Drawing on the interim results of the focus groups, this report highlights important new trends in knowledge production, diffusion and use - notably the emergence of a market for research and know-how at the interface between the public and the private sectors - and draws the main implications for public policies.  The externalisation of firms Research and Development, increased commercialisation of publicly funded research, the of proliferation of research-based start-ups, and the associated development of innovation networks, boost the development of complex and rapidly globalizing knowledge markets.  The interaction between these emerging markets and labour markets is crucial to an economys innovative performance. Highly skilled labour is still a relatively localised and nation-specific resource but is increasingly mobile. International flows of mobile human resources, especially from less developed countries, tend to converge towards highly innovative locations or clusters which are unevenly distributed across OECD countries, with the United States taking the lions share.  The importance of networks and clusters in knowledge distribution for innovation is in most countries not yet fully reflected in technology and innovation policy approaches and instruments, with an insufficient involvement of sub-national levels of government in policy design and an insufficient use of partnerships with the private sector as a privileged tool for leveraging public investment.  Governments should broaden their scope of innovation policy to include areas beyond traditional science, technology and innovation policy. Innovation policy in the knowledge-based economy needs to address interactions between the core policy areas, like science policy, technology policy and education policy, as well as the related policies like industrial, competition and regional policy.  Governments are exploring and adjusting their innovation policies, but often lag in the institutional adjustments necessary for a flexible, learning-based design and implementation of innovation policies in the innovation-driven economy. More generally, the public sector often lacks the institutional flexibility needed for a learning-based and decentralised design and implementation of innovation policies. Achieving policy coherence needs careful management of interdependencies in the innovation-driven economy and the institutional set-up. A key message coming out of the NIS project, is that governments need to target their innovation policies to specific failures in the performance of the institutions of innovation. These institutions are the firm and its knowledge management, the market and how it performs in distributing knowledge (e.g. through capital embodied knowledge flows and mechanisms for intellectual property protection), networks in competitive environments, regions and their economies of association and partnership, as well as public policy agencies or institutions expected to deliver coherent policies. Such an institutional nurturing prompts a hands-on approach by governments combined with efforts to create regulatory environments conducive to innovation.	private sector *** funded research *** innovation performance *** labour market *** skilled labour *** human resources *** private sector *** policy approaches *** public investment in research *** policy areas *** knowledge-based economy *** policy implementation *** public sector *** policy implementation *** intellectual property *** knowledge flows *** national innovation systems	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)17	FUTURE THEMATIC WORKSHOPS. PROPOSED TOPICS	2000	M	The Secretariat has prepared the following proposals/ Proposal A. ICT and Innovation. 2. ICT is widely believed to have a significant effect on the innovation process itself, helping firms increase the speed with which they bring new products and services to the market and allowing the development and manufacture of increasingly sophisticated inventions. ICT is widely cited as one of the key factor in the accelerated completion of the effort to sequence the human genome; it appears to speed innovation in molecular chemistry and product design as well. Yet, little systematic evidence exists about the kinds of effects that ICT has on innovation, their magnitude, and their duration. This workshop would provide a preliminary exploration of the ways in which ICT enhances the innovation process. It will attempt to discern patterns in the types of benefits that are achievable in different industry sectors, as well as to assess the scale and scope of those benefits. The workshop will also try to determine whether the introduction of ICT into innovation processes provides a one-time, step-like improvement in the productivity of the innovation process or whether it can provide long-term improvements in the rate of innovation.	innovation process *** new products *** innovation process *** business sector *** innovation process	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)18	DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR CSTP WORK ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND INNOVATION	2000	S	the CSTP suggested that work be undertaken on the role of patents and other forms of intellectual property (IP) protection in encouraging innovation with a particular attention to biotechnology. Focusing on the strategic use that IP holders make of their rights. The strategic behaviour of IP holders includes their use of trade secrets, various licensing strategies once they hold intellectual property rights, and opposition or litigation to minimise the rights of their competitors. Indeed, member countries are increasingly interested in: 1) understanding the impact of  restrictive licensing practices on both research and the development of new products; 2) identifying the appropriate instrument of IP protection for novel technologies, so as to avoid situations which might allow IP holders to block the progress of science and innovation; and 3) exploring the costs and benefits of various types of government interventions in the IP regime  for example, the use of compulsory licenses, conditional licenses, and anti-trust  in order to further social goals. The OECD added value lies in providing empirical data and case studies on their potential economic effects. This information could become important background material for use by governments at any future negotiations on IP harmonisation, which might take place at WIPO, the WHO, and other supra-national organisations. As noted in Berlin, the exploitation of gene based inventions are of particular concern to governments. However, other technologies and sectors are also implicated. Since each industry has its own debates over what the major IP problems are, how they might best be resolved, and who the winners and losers will be, rarely is there any cross-industry agreement on how to address these issues. For this reason, treating IP regimes as uniform will not lead to operational recommendations for governments. The TIP contribution to work on the IP challenges would have two main elements: how licensing behaviour affects the innovation process; a case study of gene based inventions. Resource permitting, follow-on work could include: Software and Business Methods, and Database protection.	intellectual property *** intellectual property *** new products *** innovation process *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)2	CONTRIBUTION TO THE OECD REPORT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: OUTLINE	2000	S	The outline is as follows. (i) introduction: Governments, business leaders, environmentalists, increasingly see the development and diffusion of cleaner technologies as necessary to resolving environmental problems. Technical progress may not always be in keeping with sustainable development goals. Explore the role of pricing and framework conditions in the development of environmental  innovations, and how government policies can increase technical responsiveness to non-market and social needs. (ii) environmental policies for innovation: explore how the use of new policy measures such as economic instruments and voluntary agreements in combination with traditional environmental regulation can promote the development and diffusion of sustainable production. While traditional command and control approaches to regulation have improved pollution abatement, they have not led to cost-effective and continued technological change. Economic instruments such as pollution charges and tradable permits have been applied in a number of OECD member countries, and seem to hold a high potential for  achieving dynamic efficiencies and stimulating the development of clean technologies. (iii) innovation policies for sustainable development: In view of the serious market and systemic failures environmental innovations are subject to, active policies are needed to stimulate research and innovation for environmental sustainability. This section will build on previous STI work to assess the effectiveness of science and technology programmes related to the environment and means for improving their design. Public/private partnership is seen as an important tool to leverage private investment as well as to promote collaborative activities among various actors that are necessary to address inter-disciplinary and complex nature of environmental innovation. Recent direction of OECD governments in their innovation policies towards environmental objectives through the use of tools such as clusters and foresight will be also examined. (iv) new technologies for sustainable development. cleaner technology includes a wider range of technologies than those used in end-of-pipe processes. New technologies, such as biotechnology and ICT, have therefore a great potential in increasing resource efficiency and fostering sustainable development. The enhanced use of these technologies depends on improved diffusion mechanisms, the provision of required skills and, notably in the case of biotechnology, adequate public understanding. (v) international cooperation on clean technologies: This section will discuss ways to enhance international Science and Technology co-operation involving both the public and private sectors to overcome these barriers so as to respond to sustainable development goals while addressing the needs of developing countries.	environmental problems *** development and diffusion *** sustainable development *** framework conditions *** economic instruments *** development and diffusion *** policy measures *** environmental policy *** technological change *** economic instruments *** clean technologies *** environmental innovations *** systemic failures *** sustainable development *** environmental sustainability *** technology programmes *** environmental innovations *** sustainable development *** new technologies *** sustainable development *** new technologies *** sustainable development *** clean technologies *** private sector *** technology co-operation *** sustainable development	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)4	NIS FOCUS GROUPS: SECOND PROGRESS REPORT	2000	P	Focus group on Clusters. In its last phase. Some of the policy issues discussed during the May workshop include: How useful is the cluster approach for the innovation policy maker in practice? Are cluster studies already used in innovation policy making to differentiate the needs of the various clusters? And how does this work out in practice? How does the cluster perspective affect regular lines of government policy making such as competition, education and social policies, and vice versa? To what degree does the cluster perspective (or the actual rise and decline of specific clusters) shape innovation and technology policies? How are (hands-off) cluster framework policies and (hands-on) cluster brokerage and demanding customer policies balanced in practice? How are strongly internationalised clusters dealt with? What are best practice cluster innovation policies? Focus group on mobility: What emerged from the presentations on domestic mobility was the confirmation that the Community Labour Force Survey (CLFS) could be used to estimate mobility rates. Several questions, e.g. the use of educational classifications and various definitions of mobility were clarified. The need to clarify how the questions used as the base for calculating the mobility  rates were actually phrased in the national CLS was identified. Focus group on innovative firms and networks: For the workshop in the autumn a framework/typology of network facilitating policy will be elaborated, addressing different types of perceived market/co-ordination failures. In the conceptual paper presented by the Finnish participants different types of governance failures that could warrant government intervention were analysed, including the proposition for a sophisticated decision making model to help governments to see inefficiencies of economic organisations more generally. The work on innovative firms has been delayed.	policy frameworks *** best practices *** innovative firms *** innovative firms	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)5	SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY OUTLOOK 2000 CHAPTER VII: INNOVATION NETWORKS	2000	O	It has become widely recognised in recent years that innovation processes are characterised by a considerable degree of interaction and division of labour, i.e. networking. The network concept has also received increasing prominence in studies examining the evolving cognitive structures of knowledge. Economists tend to regard the network as a new mode of interaction, somewhere between markets and hierarchies. The capability to network is increasingly regarded as a source of value to firms that contributes to learning and knowledge generation (Kogut, 1998). Social and economic networks are affected by physical networks (e.g. telecommunication and traffic networks), but have also become significant on their own as a distinctive organisational form. Metcalfe (1995) suggested that networks can be seen as economic clubs acting to internalise the problems of effective knowledge transmission. The potential wide-ranging impacts of networks on its members and on the economy as a whole has contributed to a growing amount of research on networks, and has also made it an important option for technology and innovation policy, especially in European countries. In stimulating co-operation between different actors in the innovation system, policy makers expect that synergies can be achieved and that the innovation potential can be better exploited in existing and in new firms, in research, and in society as a whole. But the policies remain insufficiently clear. Should policy makers stimulate networks by relaxing antitrust laws? Should governments stimulate or prevent inter-firm agreements?  This chapter aims to clarify these issues. Section 2 briefly reviews the theoretical literature and the different approaches to networking. A short overview of the different characteristics of networking is provided in section 3. Section 4 summarises the various benefits of networks and inter-firm co-operation, while section 5 discusses some empirical findings. The final section discusses some practical problems of networking and the role that governments can play at different stages of the networking process.	innovation process *** innovation systems	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)6/REV1	INDUSTRY-SCIENCE RELATIONSHIPS: INTERIM REPORT	2000	R	In the new economy, science is exerting a more important and direct influence on innovation, especially in fast growing new industries. The intensity and quality of industry-science relationships (ISRs) thus play an increasing role in determining returns on investment in research, in terms of competitiveness, growth, job creation and quality of life. They also determine the ability of countries to attract or retain highly mobile qualified labour.  ISRs are undergoing fundamental changes prompted by globalisation and other factors as part of an overall trend towards accelerated development of a market for knowledge. The most visible transformations are the emergence of broad alliances between universities and firms (giving rise, inter alia, to booming co-patenting activities), and to growing commercialisation of results through licensing of intellectual property and spin-off companies (e.g. during the 1990s, US universities more than doubled their propensity to patent).  There is accumulating evidence that many OECD countries are lagging behind in the modernisation of ISRs. At the same time, countries that are forging ahead in building new, more flexible models of ISRs, experience new challenges.  To benchmark ISRs is to compare their relative efficiency in meeting and reconciling the needs of the main stakeholders (governments, industry, public research organisations, civil society), and to relate differences in performance to observable characteristics of industry-science linkages, focusing on those aspects that are amenable to policy. To this end industry-science linkages are characterised and evaluated along three dimensions: nature and relative importance of the channels of interaction, their incentive structures, and their institutional arrangements.  Regarding the channels of interaction, the report focuses on labour mobility and spin-offs. Despite a general trend towards relaxing regulatory constraints, a low rate of mobility of researchers between the private and public sectors remains in many countries a major bottleneck to ISRs. The contribution of spin-offs from publicly funded research to innovation is significant, especially in the information technology and, increasingly, the biotechnology/medical technologies sectors. The rate of spin-off formation, which may be a good indicator of the health of ISRs, is about three to four times higher in North America than in most other OECD countries.  Regarding incentive structures, the report focuses on intellectual property rights and on research evaluation systems. In nearly all OECD countries there has been a trend towards transferring ownership of publicly funded research results from the state (government) to the (public or private) agent performing the research. Where countries differ is in the allocation of ownership among performing agents (research institution versus individual researcher). An interim conclusion is that a good practice might be to grant INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT ownership to the performing research organisation but to ensure that researchers enjoy a fair share of resulting royalties. Evaluation of research must evolve in response to the considerable expansion of the commercialisation activities of universities and public research institutes, and evaluation criteria must take into account that excellence in research and training of graduates has become, at least in some disciplines, more tied to applications in industry.  Regarding institutional arrangements, the report views university-based systems of ISRs as enjoying a comparative advantage when science-based innovation increasingly requires multidisciplinarity and builds on people-based interactions. In the last decade a majority of OECD countries have redirected public Research and Development investment towards universities, to the detriment of research institutes. But this shift has not improved ISRs to the same extent everywhere. A major reason is that decentralised university systems, in which universities enjoy more freedom in their research policy and relations with industry, are more responsive to opportunities for ISRs than centralised ones. Governments should be aware of the fact that giving more weight to commercialisation objectives in allocating core funding can only accentuate the polarisation of university research capabilities around existing centres of excellence. The report discusses how to enhance the contribution of public research institutes to innovation, as well as to improve their linkages with universities. Finally, it assesses the strengths and weaknesses of different models for organising commercialisation activities in the public research sector.	job creation *** research investments *** industry-science relationships *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** industry-science relationships *** institutional arrangements *** incentive structures *** industry-science relationships *** labour mobility *** public sector *** funded research *** information technology *** spin-off formation *** evaluation systems *** intellectual property *** evaluation of research *** incentive structures *** funded research *** research results *** research organisations *** good practices *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** research performance *** evaluation of research *** research organisations *** comparative advantage *** institutional arrangements *** research and development expenditures *** research organisations *** public research and development *** research organisations *** public research sector *** industry-science relationships	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)7	ANALYTICAL REPORT ON HIGH TECH SPIN-OFFS	2000	R	1. The main objectives of this document are: 1) to review and analyse the information available across OECD countries on spin-offs from public research activities; and 2) to draw on this review to inform the policy debate on spin-off creation and development in the context of the project on Benchmarking Science-Industry Relationships. 2. Based on data submitted by member countries, the paper demonstrates that over the course of the past two decades spin-off generation has become a much more common channel of technology transfer. The number of spin-offs is generally on the rise, although a couple countries seem to have experienced a peak in spin-off formation in the late eighties or early nineties. However, the magnitude of the phenomenon in terms of number of new firms created remains relatively modest. In most OECD countries, spin-offs are much rarer than new technology based firms, and probably play a different role in the innovation system. The policies in support of these two types of firms should thus not be one and the same. 3. The Secretariat questionnaire also probed countries about the technological specialisation, financing needs, size, growth prospects, and lifecycle of their spin-offs. Public sector spin-offs are often very small firms with 25 employees or less. Despite their size, public spin-offs have higher survival rates than average new firms. In many countries public spin-offs benefit from a variety of support schemes, which might help explain their longevity. Equity investments are also on the rise, which is consistent with other indications that research institutions are taking a longer term, more hands on approach to fostering spin-offs. The pay-off to such investments is not entirely understood. Less than a quarter of US spin-off firms have brought a product to market and a third of the Canadian spin-offs have no sales. Spin-offs may primarily be consulting or contract-research firms whose main economic contribution is to act as an intermediary between the public and private sector. 4. Furthermore, spin-offs are heavily concentrated in the information and health technologies. While it is true that innovations in these fields are dependent on advances in the basic sciences, the relative paucity of spin-offs in other science-based begs an explanation. What are the characteristics of the research base, the technological cycle, or the industry structure and its competitive dynamics that make spin-offs a viable commercial strategy? Answers to these questions will help focus spin-off promotional programmes. Resources should not be expended on promoting spin-offs in disciplines or industries in which are not amenable to this form of technology transfer. Policymakers also need to think about how much they want to invest in a mechanism that favours one industry rather than firm creation as a whole. 5. The establishment of benchmarks for spin-off formation will help governments identify  for a certain research budget and staff, scientific portfolio, or type of public institution  what level of spin-off activity could be a good target and whether it is being met. The data presented in this paper takes a first step in that direction by giving a general sense of the range of spin-off activity across the OECD and in individual institutions. A next step is to normalise this information by research budgets, researchers, types of institutions, and field of specialisation. Finally, the Secretariat envisions evaluating the various policy instruments for spin-off formation.	research activities *** public research *** technology transfer *** spin-off formation *** new technologies *** innovation systems *** technology based firms *** public sector *** small and medium sized firms *** support schemes *** research organisations *** private sector *** research base *** technology transfer *** spin-off formation *** policy instruments *** spin-off formation	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)8	BACKGROUND REPORT FOR WORKSHOP 1 ON ENHANCING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF chabadu chabados THROUGH INNOVATION AT THE BOLOGNA CONFERENCE (13-15 June 2000)	2000	R	his paper serves as the background document for the Workshop on Enhancing the Competitiveness of chabadu chabados through Innovation at the Bologna conference. Highlights  For chabadu chabados in the OECD, economic globalisation has created new competitors, especially in low labour cost countries, but also greater incentives and opportunities to access the various markets and knowledge sources needed to build lasting competitive advantage through continuous innovation.  chabadu chabados are a heterogeneous population of firms whose contributions to the innovation system are wide ranging and include not only Research and Development based new products and services, but also improved designs and processes and the adoption of new technologies.  Strategies to enhance the global competitiveness of innovative chabadu chabados should take into account that: -- New information and communication technologies facilitate global reach and help reduce the disadvantage of scale economies which small firms face in all aspects of business. -- Flexible specialisation has proven to be a particularly successful model of industrial organisation: through close co-operation with other firms chabadu chabados can take advantage of knowledge externalities and rapidly respond to market changes. -- Despite economic globalisation and the ability to transmit information rapidly and cheaply, geographic boundaries still matter. Clustering is particularly important to gain access to new ideas and tacit knowledge, especially in young industries. -- Specialisation in a market niche compensates for some of the disadvantages of small scale. -- While there are more hurdles to overcome for a small firm setting up affiliates abroad, the benefits in terms of access to new markets and knowledge can be immense.  Despite the fact that globalisation reduces the degrees of freedom governments have in their policy responses, they can still play an important role in encouraging chabadu chabados to innovate and to implement the strategies required to effectively meet the globalisation challenge, through appropriate regulation, incentives, and institutional learning.  However because of the heterogeneity of the chabadu chabados population, any policy to increase their innovative capacities must be targeted to meet the needs of a variety of user groups, have different objectives, and use multiple approaches and tools.  For High-tech chabadu chabados (the technology developers or lead technology users), which make up less than 15% of the total chabadu chabados population, the most important goals are to promote the development of the private venture capital industry and associated services, and to adjust accordingly the management and objectives of public Research and Development granting programmes.  For the vast majority of chabadu chabados (the technology followers), novel technology and innovation policies should better address their needs, especially in regards to: non-financial innovation advice such as consulting services; recruitment of university graduates and skilled personnel; awareness of new ideas and technologies; and incentives and institutional frameworks for improving collaborations within networks and clusters, including local technical centres or technical colleges.	small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** new technologies *** small and medium sized firms *** new products *** innovation systems *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** tacit knowledge *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** innovation capacity *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** public research and development *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms	firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP(2000)9	BERLIN CONFERENCE ON BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY-SCIENCE RELATIONSHIPS	2000	W2	The efficient interaction between science and industry is increasingly considered one of the driving factors in the performance of regional and national innovation systems as well as in overall economic growth. Recent policy and academic discussions stress the importance of knowledge and technology transfer as an instrument for enhancing innovation and competitiveness of countries. However the underlying rationale behind technology transfer is increasingly being challenged and may lead to erroneous policy choices since it attempts to address the symptoms of poor innovative performance rather than the causes. Most knowledge and technology transfer government support schemes are based on a linear model of innovation whereby basic research leads to applied research and is transformed into commercial products and processes. Yet both innovations and inventions are increasingly the result of networking and interactions between actors at different stages in the innovation process. Innovation also is increasingly determined by: The growing interdisciplinary in scientific research which has increased the complexity of technology development that in turn relies more on teams of researchers, rather than individuals, and collaboration with a wide variety of actors. An increasing amount of scientific knowledge emerges from the application of research (including by industry) that has blurred the borders between basic and applied research, both of which cross- fertilize one another. Given that the performance of national innovation systems strongly depends on the links between the individual actors of that system, it is important that governments foster the right framework conditions for collaboration between industry and science. However, while knowledge and technology transfer schemes can have short-term impacts, they may not be sustainable. Another issue is that it seems necessary to strengthen the links between actors in the science system along with intensifying links to industry. This has implications on the following general policy areas: general innovation policy, technology policy, fiscal policy, legal frameworks (esp. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT policies) and education policy. Issue 1: The changing role of universities and public research institutions. Traditionally universities play a dual role in the innovation process. On the one hand they act as major research partners for industry and on the other hand, they train and qualify future scientists and highly skilled personnel. Yet in most countries, universities are organized in faculties and departments independent from one another in terms of research, education and funding. The blurring of basic and applied research is increasingly challenging this disciplinary-based mode of knowledge production. There is no conclusive evidence that intensified collaboration between industry and university affects academic research and teaching negatively, but there is concern that it may limit the diffusion of public research and the exchange of knowledge between scientists especially if basic research and teaching tools are patented. The relationship between industry and science does not only concern the exploitation of research results but also encompasses the marketing of the research institutions knowledge capital. As universities build their own industrial structures (e.g. incubators, venture funds, licensing offices), the issue of potential distortion in the market for knowledge emerges as in most countries a considerable number of private research institutions increasingly compete with publicly supported research institutes for industrial and public Research and Development funds. Issue 2: Innovative instruments for joint value creation at the industry  science  interface. Company spin-offs from the public research sector play an important role in the dynamism of national innovation systems and are a main indicator of the intensity and impact of industry-science relations. Recent evidence suggests that the major challenges facing new ventures at the industry-science interface stem from weak management capabilities (especially marketing know-how), the availability of qualified personnel (especially for ICT ventures), and weaknesses in strategic planning and orientation. For researchers in public research institutes, finance also remains a major barrier to academic entrepreneurship. Yet public support for new ventures varies over the venture life cycle and is mainly targeted to pre- competitive development. Exploitation of intellectual property is considered a source of potential revenue for universities and public research institutions. However, experience shows that most revenue is generated by only a small number of patents/licenses. Hence research institutions face the challenge of building a portfolio of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT large enough to be self-financed. Research institutions thus have an incentive to issue as many licenses as possible to assure satisfactory diffusion of technology and to attract a number of different customers. Small and medium-sized enterprises still face external financing problems for innovation. Many of them also lack the capacity to access information and identify opportunities for collaboration with the public science system. One issue is to what extent can policy provide chabadu chabados with information and incentives to acquire technologies and knowledge from the most appropriate source available (and not necessarily from the closest geographic source). Issue 3: Successful industry- science-relationships for economic renewal. Public research in some scientific/technological fields such as life sciences or information and communication technologies has generated substantial economic impacts partly through the creation of  new highly Research and Development intensive industries. In these areas, scientists from the public research sector or industrial companies have established a considerable number of new ventures. Due to the scientific background of the founders and the reliance of further development on new knowledge, those new ventures generally maintain a strong link to the public research base. In contrast, the potential contribution of industry-science relationships for modernizing mature industries has long been underestimated or even neglected. Mature industrial companies, especially in sectors protected from national and international competition, often lack the capacities to assimilate knowledge from universities or engage in collaboration. On the other hand, it may be misleading to assume that simply establishing a research institution or university in any region will attract industrial companies and lead to the creation of a vibrant innovation cluster. It may be more important to create  sufficient critical mass of research capabilities in one region by building and attracting human capital in the region. Learning networks also play a role in making public research an attractive partner for mature industries. Issue 4: Industry - science - relationship in the context of globalization. For both public research and industry, openness matters for being able to benefit from globalization. Industry for one needs to maintain an absorption capacity so that it can tap foreign sources of knowledge. Public research institutions play a role in helping industry sustain that capacity. Besides the increasing internationalization of business Research and Development and commercial activities, there is a steady rise in international co-operation in science and academia. Regular Research and Development activity, especially on an international scale, seems to be positively correlated with more active industry-science relationships. The decision on external knowledge and technology acquisition depends on scientific excellence and on financial matters, especially for large and Research and Development intensive companies. Another issue arising from globalisation concerns efforts by regional and national governments to attract not only physical investment in production facilities by companies but accompanying Research and Development investment to foster sustainable local/regional economic growth. The existing research infrastructure at the local/regional level is in many cases an important precondition for attracting foreign investment in high-technology industries. The increasing internationalization of science forces research institutes and universities not only to introduce research results to an international community but also to buy in inventions from other institutions worldwide. Globalisation is also challenging universities and public labs to open themselves up not only to national, but also to foreign industrial partners and this requires changes in institutional structures and missions. Issue 5: Getting leverage from Human Capital. It is widely accepted that the most effective method of knowledge transfer is through people. Consequently, the mobility for scientists and researchers between the public sector and industry is considered important for diffusing knowledge. In many countries, however, there are significant regulatory barriers and disincentives to the movement of researchers between public and private sectors. These barriers include weak demand from industry, especially in regions or countries where industry performs a low share of Research and Development; public employment legislation such as rules on the portability of pensions or public pay systems; and reward structures for public researchers. Another issue relates to restrictions on dual employment and participation in entrepreneurial ventures that also limit researcher collaboration with industry, as well as the creation of spin-offs and new science-based industries. While research institutions traditionally encourage temporary movement of researchers through staff exchange and sabbaticals, such movement tends to be geared towards supporting research in other public institutions and publication imperatives rather than collaboration with industry. Changing human resource management of researchers in industry is also requiring changes in the training and management of researchers in the public sector, especially as industry-science collaboration increases. Issue 6: Evaluation of industry - science relationships: Discussions about best practice in knowledge and technology transfer remain academic as long as there are no agreed upon indicators to somehow measure successful performance of science-industry relationships. Usually there is an underestimation due to a lack of sufficient and appropriate indicators. For the  evaluation  and  assessment  of  science-industry-linkages  a  two   level   approach   seems   adequate: assessing the transfer performance at country level and at the research institution level. Due to an increasing number of evaluations by research institutes, the latter is already rather extensively documented. There has been less research on assessing transfer at the country level however.  In most countries knowledge and technology transfer is evaluated and assessed as part of evaluation programmes of research institutions or public support programmes. At the level of research institutions, a series of indicators for measuring performing in technology transfer are used. These measures essentially relate to financial issues such as external revenues, overhead costs, royalties, turnover generated, etc.  While useful in themselves, they provide only a narrowly focused snapshot of past performance and give little indication of likely performance in the future. Evaluation systems in public research institutions must go far beyond the traditional metrics, which in most cases rely mainly on refereed publications only, and consider commercialisation outputs such as patents (at one level with publications). Moreover evaluation schemes need to set incentives for researchers to engage in industry contacts but at the same time ensure that industry collaboration does not outweigh longer-term blue-sky research.	economic growth *** national innovation systems *** technological knowledge *** technology transfer *** innovation performance *** technology transfer *** model of innovation ***

DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)11	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS PROPOSED BY MEXICO	2001	W2	The objectives of the conference are to: (1) Review and assess the experience of participating countries in the design and implementation of public/private/partnerships in advanced technologies as a means to foster innovation performance; (2) Examine the role that international PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS can play in broadening the international pool and diffusion of knowledge and facilitating technology transfers; and (3) Examine the critical factors determining the success of domestic and international Public Private Partnerships for innovation with a view to identify good policy practices regarding institutional and financing arrangements, and programme management and evaluation. Session 1: PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for innovation, Overview of countries experience: While they have been in existence for a number of years in many countries, Public Private Partnerships seem to play an increasing and changing role in Science and Technology and Innovation policy. This session will be devoted to an overview of countries experience regarding evolving policy rationales underlying Public Private Partnerships (notably in high tech fields), new forms and objectives of Public Private Partnerships, outcomes and policy implications in terms of design, implementation and assessment. It will in particular address the question of the selection of technological fields for which Public Private Partnerships are implemented.  Session 2: Cross-country PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS as an instrument of international co-operation in chabadi chabado: In designing Public Private Partnership programmes governments need to take into account the international dimension at least on two counts: (1) domestic participating firms are involved in borderless innovation networks, and (2) there might be value to design such programmes from the start as international ones as specific modes on international Science and Technology co-operation involving public and private actors. This session will focus on policy requirements, institutional arrangements and incentive systems that can enhance international co- operation in innovation ventures, facilitate knowledge flows in transborder innovative networks, and reduce international gaps in innovation capabilities through cross border partnerships or technology consortia.  Session 3: Financing PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS: Besides their important role in enhancing knowledge creation and diffusion through co-operation between the public and the private sector on mission-oriented Research and Development, Public Private Partnerships provide an efficient framework for increasing the leverage effect of public investment on private Research and Development expenditures, especially through cost sharing of Research and Development investment in high risk projects. This session will focus on the various financing schemes and incentive structures that can be put in place in the design of Public Private Partnerships and facilitate the involvement of both public research institutions and private firms, including chabadu chabados. The session will also address  financing issues related to cross border Public Private Partnerships. Session 4: Management of public/private partnership: Due to the involvement of public and private partners in their implementation and, to an increasing extent, their design, Public Private Partnership programmes raise specific management issues that condition their success. Among such issues on which this session will focus figure prominently those related to centralised vs. decentralised management, procedures for selecting public and private partners that ensure excellence and do not discriminate against potential participants, complementarity between public (social) interests and private ones, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs sharing, and programmes outcomes assessment. International partnerships raise important additional management issues that could also be examined. Session 5: Reaping the full benefits of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS: Public Private Partnerships generate investments in Research and Development and innovation that may not have taken place in their absence and, as such give rise to positive externalities. In this sense, potential economic benefits of Public Private Partnerships and other forms of Science and Technology co-operation between research institutions and industry can be larger than those expected from the partners involved in co-operation programmes. Reaping the full benefits of such programmes requires that attention be given to the diffusion of new generated knowledge to foster the innovative performance of the economy at large. This applies in the case of national programmes but is probably even more important in the case of international co-operation that raises the issue of striking an appropriate balance between the fulfilment of national objectives and the international sharing of economic benefits. This session will focus on the policy requirements and institutional arrangements that may be needed to ensure that the outcomes of Public Private Partnerships and other co-operation programmes in advanced technologies can contribute to raise the innovative capacity of a wide spectrum of enterprises and foster the creation of new ones. Specific  attention should be given to international co-operation programmes involving less advanced countries  with weaker innovation systems.	innovation performance *** public private partnerships *** policy practices *** diffusion of knowledge *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** new forms of innovation *** public private partnerships *** technology fields *** international co-operation *** private partnerships in sti *** public private partnerships *** technology co-operation *** innovation capacity *** technology co-operation *** institutional arrangements *** knowledge flows *** research and development expenditures *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** mission-oriented research *** public investment in research *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** private firms *** small and medium sized firms *** public private partnerships *** incentive structures *** research organisations *** public private partnerships *** private partnerships in sti *** public private partnerships *** private partnerships in sti *** intellectual property *** private partnerships in sti *** public private partnerships *** research investments *** public private partnerships *** research organisations *** technology co-operation *** innovation performance *** international co-operation *** public private partnerships *** innovation capacity *** institutional arrangements *** international co-operation *** innovation systems *** public private partnerships	objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** internationalisation_globalisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)12 part1	REPORT ON WORKSHOP ON CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGIES FOR Research and Development AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR chabadi chabado. Part 1: Findings regarding business Research and Development.	2001	W2	The Workshop presentations reinforced the notion outlined in the Issues paper that a new division of labour is emerging in the funding, conduct, and focus of businesses strategies for their research and development. Businesses are shifting the focus of their internal Research and Development efforts away from more basic  research discoveries and toward more clear-cut business opportunities. They are more actively entering  into collaboration with and exploiting external sources of knowledge. At the same time firms are seeking new avenues for commercialising internally developed research results through licensing and the creation of spin-off firms. Venture capital has become an integral part of the business Research and Development system in leading OECD countries, financing a significant amount of Research and Development in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Workshop participants generally agreed on a number of characteristics of the emerging strategy for business Research and Development. The degree to which these characteristics are exhibited in firm strategies appears to depend somewhat on their industry sector and home country, but the Workshop did not provide sufficient opportunity to fully explore these differences: (i) Business Research and Development is increasingly motivated by business strategy. Business Research and Development investments are no longer made in a support role that is only indirectly linked to business objectives, but are driven by business strategy. The kinds of Research and Development projects firms choose to pursue are increasingly linked to the development of new products, processes, and services, and firms actively seek to demonstrate financial returns on their Research and Development investments. Microsoft, for example, claims that virtually all of its new products incorporate technology developed by Microsoft Research, even though the laboratories are not charged specifically with generating near-term results, but with ensuring the future of the firm. Mitsubishi Materials Research and Development operations have been aligned with its separate business units to more closely link Research and Development to product development and customer needs. (ii) Societal concerns shape business strategies for Research and Development. While business strategy dominates Research and Development decisions, firms are increasingly aware of other social pressures as well. Several speakers highlighted the growing importance of societal concerns in shaping future directions for business Research and Development. EIRMA identified concerns over globalisation, denial of IP protection in crises such as AIDS, open source software, and environmental concerns as both influencing the kinds of Research and Development firms choose to pursue and the ways in which they conduct Research and Development. Speakers from Merck, Mitsubishi Materials, and the University of Paris-Dauphine echoed these sentiments. (iii) External collaborations are becoming more important to business Research and Development. Research and Development-conducting firms are entering into a range of relationships with other firms (large and small), universities, and government laboratories to pursue their Research and Development objectives. They use collaborative  research, licensing, corporate venture capital (CVC) investments, and mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to complement their internal capabilities. This pattern represents a dramatic shift from the paradigm that dominated business Research and Development (research, in particular) in previous decades, in which businesses relied more exclusively on their internal efforts. Merck researchers, for example, are charged with not only generating new internal research, but also with accessing external research discoveries to create a virtual lab that combines both internal and external research. Over half the new chemical entities in active development in the pharmaceutical industry in 2001 are estimated to come from external, and more than a third  of Mercks drug sales come from externally developed products. (iv) Links to universities have taken on a new importance in stimulating business Research and Development. Businesses do not view universities as a pool of inexpensive labour for contract research,  but as an increasingly important source of scientific and technological ideas that can aid  industrial innovation. Microsoft reportedly spends 20% of its research budget (approximately USD 75 million in 2000) on university research related to software. The intent is not to find solutions to particular development problems Microsoft is facing, but to expand the knowledge base that the software industry can tap into. It funds top researchers to conduct work in areas related to Microsofts interests (such as its .Net initiative), but does not attempt to keep the results proprietary. (v) Externalising internal technologies. In addition to making greater use of knowledge produced elsewhere, firms are also seeking ways to benefit financially from Research and Development results that have   been produced but that do not fit into their business plans or match their competencies. Leading firms are not attempting to thwart the processes of diffusion, but are developing processes to leverage and profit from them, such as through spin-offs and licensing. Spin-offs and start-ups are seen as conducting experiments with technologies that may reveal new technical possibilities and/or new market opportunities. They may become sources of new technology for the larger firms current businesses. Similarly, IP is seen as a tool for accessing external technology that might be vital to advancing ones own business and as a marketing channel for capturing further value from IP that might not be fully utilised internally. Instead of constraining IP to be used solely within the firm, firms aggressively market technology to their competitors  and then charge them licensing fees to do so. This process forces internal development activities to compete with external development  activities at other firms, to justify their additional value added. (vi) Globalisation is a central part of business Research and Development. Firms are increasingly globalising their Research and Development activities in order to tap into centres of scientific and technological excellence. Microsoft has research centres in China and Europe, in addition to its main centre in the United States Intel, as a result of its international venture capital investments, now has Research and Development activities in 15 countries. Canon established a research centre in Rennes, France to exploit local talent for its world-wide operations. Even smaller firms, such as AVL-List have had to expand internationally in order to participate in global industries, such as automobiles. Such investments underscore the importance of strong science and technology bases to attract foreign investment in local Research and Development. At the same time, much of the technology developed in foreign labs will be exploited in foreign markets. Canons revised strategy allows its foreign research labs to pursue Research and Development in support of local market needs and to deploy research results in local products. Microsofts research labs have competencies that are linked to local needs; its China lab, for example, specialises in speech and character recognition. (vii) The implications of changing business Research and Development strategies on fundamental/basic research are unclear. An international survey of large Research and Development-conducting firms indicates that firms are decreasing support for basic research in favour of research that is directed to new business. Concerns over the declining appropriability of research results may reinforce this trend. Alcatels Research and Development strategy illustrates this pattern; despite rapidly growing Research and Development expenditures, more of Alcatels Research and Development effort is aimed at developing new products by recombining existing technologies rather than at generating fundamental, new discoveries. Nevertheless, both Microsoft and Merck reported growing investments in basic research. In both of these firms, such research is seen as supporting their business objectives. These companies also reported increasing support for university-based research, which may offset cutbacks in fundamental research in industry. (viii) The changes seen in business Research and Development strategies reflect enduring changes in the business, economic, and social environment. While CVC and M&A activity was undoubtedly fuelled by increased stock valuations of the late 1990s, the externalisation of business Research and Development reflects more permanent changes in the economy, including: continued globalisation and growing competition in world markets (and the concomitant erosion of dominant market positions of many large firms), expanding technological opportunity resulting from new scientific and technological advances, increasing mobility of skilled workers; growth of university research; the more diffuse distribution of knowledge; and the enormous increase in venture capital. These changes compromise the ability of companies with significant internal Research and Development investments to appropriate the returns on those investments and make technology more mobile. Intel and Merck reported that their CVC and M&A activity would be affected by the recent economic downturn, but emphasised that they would continue to use such mechanisms to access technology.	international research *** research results *** venture capital *** business research and development *** business research and development *** business research and development *** business strategies *** business sector *** home country *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** business strategies *** research and development expenditures *** new products *** new products *** product development *** business strategies *** business strategies *** business research and development *** business research and development *** venture capital *** business research and development *** international research *** business research and development *** industrial innovation *** contract research *** knowledge base *** software industry *** new technologies *** development activities *** business research and development *** research and development activities *** venture capital *** research and development activities *** foreign direct investment *** research results *** business research and development *** development strategies *** basic research *** basic research *** research results *** existing technologies *** development strategies *** new products *** research and development expenditures *** basic research *** fundamental research *** business research and development *** development strategies *** venture capital *** business research and development *** international research *** research and development expenditures *** business strategies *** business research and development	policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)12 part2	REPORT ON WORKSHOP ON CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGIES FOR Research and Development AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR chabadi chabado. Part 2: Implications for chabadi chabado.	2001	W2	Although the primary focus of the Workshop was on better delineating the changing patterns of business Research and Development, participants introduced a number of ideas regarding ways in which government policy might need to change to better support business innovation. These ideas will need to be further analysed and tested to determine their validity. They are presented here both to create a record of the Workshop and to stimulate further discussion. Overall, the ideas put forward suggest that promising policy measures will be more indirect, seeking to improve the conditions for knowledge generation, diffusion, and utilisation in the business sector. The emphasis will need to be on not only Research and Development policies, but also on policies related to intellectual property, human resources, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This implies a stronger role for Government as rule-maker, referee, and facilitator of innovation. This shifting role will diminish the ability of Government to deliver highly visible results in Research and Development, raises questions about how this new approach can be sustained politically. (i) Government support of basic fundamental research is increasingly important. As became clear in the workshop discussions, few firms can afford to finance fundamental research in  the current competitive environment which strains firms Research and Development resources (in an attempt to get quickly to market) and in which numerous competitors stand ready to capitalise on advances in science and technology. Given the importance of science and technology to innovation in a number of business sectors, more of the burden may fall upon government. One participant noted that the faster rate of diffusion of knowledge throughout an economy might make it harder for governments to stimulate fundamental research in the business sector, increasing the need for strong public science systems. The speaker from Confindustria emphasised the need for governments to concentrate on funding quality science, an objective few could disagree with, but that may require changes in the way government Research and Development funding is awarded. (ii) Feeding the fish, not the sharks. Instead of directly targeting specific firms to serve as the engines of innovation, government policy may do better to develop and cultivate the soil in which innovative firms can grow. As noted by Mr. Serris, from the French Ministry of Research, government chabadi chabado can not focus exclusively on large firms that are increasingly mobile; rather it may be more effective to create more numerous smaller firms that develop particular scientific competencies and become attractive targets for multinational investment. Multinationals bring with them additional technology as well as jobs. (iii) Encouraging diversity. Related to the above, the interplay between science and technology suggests that policy should promote mechanisms that stimulate experimentation by firms and increase the amount of recombination of new and existing ideas. Policy must enrich the soil for companies to conduct experiments, take risks, and attempt new combinations of knowledge. This suggests that policy should actively seek to incorporate participation from start-ups and chabadu chabados in the conduct of research. It should also ensure that they have access to the results of publicly funded research investigations. (iv) Intellectual property rights. While one speaker suggested that the importance of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT in the innovation process was over-stated, (citing the fact that only a small percentage of awarded patents are utilised), most agreed that INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT is a more important mechanism for diffusing technology than in the past. Policy should remain concerned with the trade-off between protecting rights to inventions and encouraging their diffusion, but recent shifts in the Research and Development strategies of private firms suggest that markets can play a more important role in promoting diffusion than perhaps in the past. As companies look to make greater use of their IP outside of their own businesses, the supply of knowledge available in the market should increase. Thus, governments should clarify the ownership of IP and provide the institutional and legal support for their purchase and exchange. (v) Licensing the results of public research. A further and more nettlesome issue is whether and how the government should assign IP rights to the results of research that it funds itself. In  the United States, for example, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 allowed universities who conducted research with government funds to file for patents on results from that research, patents to be owned by the university. The results of this social experiment are hotly debated but are very important. If industry in future is going to rely increasingly on government and especially university research for its seed corn, issues of this sort become critical  policy levers that can enable or thwart the advance of a countrys innovation system. Effective solutions will require careful crafting of policy. The speaker from Canon identified particular aspects of IP rules in France that may preclude the firm from entering into Research and Development partnerships with public research organisations in France. (v) Developing human resources. Developing and maintaining a skilled labour force requires governments to ensure high quality education at the primary, secondary,  and  university levels. As populations age, and as the half-life of training shortens, policy will also need to address training and life long learning after graduation as well. Related to issues of creating a skilled workforce, are policies that facilitate the mobility of that workforce. Pensions, benefits, health care, and other aspects of compensation today are typically tied to employment, and this effectively constrains mobility. Making these portable, or severing their tie to a specific employer, might enhance mobility and enable workers to seek out the best opportunities to utilise their skills.  (vi) Promoting entrepreneurship. New firms appear to be an effective means of developing new technology and introducing it to the market place. While policies to encourage commercialisation of public research results are one way to promote start-up firms, a broader series of policy initiatives can help stimulate entrepreneurship. A particularly important role for policy is to promote the development of effective capital markets for the formation of start-up firms, and for supporting the growth of chabadu chabados. This is a deep and wide-ranging topic in itself, but it includes issues of bankruptcy law and the extent of personal liability, the ability to issue stock to investors and employees, the treatment of capital gains on equity investments, the treatment of stock options issued to employees (such as when these are taxable events), the regulatory requirements for listing stocks on public exchanges, and the depth and rigor of financial reporting requirements. One participant noted the need to find ways of accounting for intangible assets (e.g. investments in intellectual property, Research and Development, worker training) on corporate balance sheets, much as goodwill is included today, to allow companies to better account for their intellectual assets. (vii) Mobilising support. Another unanswered issue is how to build and sustain political support for government Science and Technology and innovation programmes, especially as they shift from supporting individual firms to creating an environment that is more conducive to innovation. A key  virtue of direct incentives is that the beneficiaries of this policy know who they are, and can mobilise support for incentives-based policies. The policies noted above are far more indirect, such that most ultimate beneficiaries of those policies are harder to identify specifically. Mobilising support for these indirect policies could prove to be a difficult task.	business research and development *** business innovation *** policy measures *** business sector *** intellectual property *** human resources *** fundamental research *** fundamental research *** business sector *** business sector *** fundamental research *** diffusion of knowledge *** knowledge economy *** science system *** innovative firms *** small and medium sized firms *** funded research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** innovation process *** private firms *** development strategies *** public research results *** funded research *** research results *** innovation systems *** research organisations *** human resources *** skilled labour *** health care *** new technologies *** public research results *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** intellectual assets *** business strategies	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)14	OECD FOCUS GROUP ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND INNOVATION NOTE ON CASE STUDIES	2001	S	Case studies can either be used for deepening individual INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT issues raised in the questionnaire  on PROs which need additional clarification or for broadening the issues (i.e. dealing with INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT-related issues not covered in the questionnaire and not necessarily limited to the functioning of PROs). First and foremost, case studies should be empirical. The case should tell a story about how a particular country, sector or actor is dealing with INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and explain the practical trade offs and choices made. We can imagine that these empirical case studies could focus on a number of different issues including: Providing a national perspective, Providing a sectoral perspective, The INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT policy-making process itself (and how it is changing), Categories of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT actors. Nevertheless, every case study should ultimately contribute to: (i) Understanding the specificity of the institutional context of IP use in a country, how this is changing and point at key considerations/trade offs and solutions found/proposed. (ii) Giving insight into the sort of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT strategies pursued by the various actors involved and the implications for INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT policies, especially those towards PROs. (iii) Identifying policy lessons, especially with regard to how INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT policies might benefit wider innovation policy-making.	intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)15	DYNAMISING NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS	2001	R	1. This report presents a synthesis of the main findings of the OECD project on National Innovation Systems. This project has spanned some 7 years and three phases of project implementation. It was carried out under the auspices of the Committee for chabadi chabado (CSTP) and its working party for Technology and Innovation Policy (TIP). The synthesis covers the full project, but concentrates on the most recent outcomes. It is based mainly on the work of three Focus Groups that did analytical work in the last phase of the project on three areas: Clusters, innovative firms and networks, and human resource mobility. They have all reported their work in a series of OECD proceedings being published during the summer and fall of 2001. 2. The NIS approach rests on the interactive model of the innovation process that puts an emphasis on market and non-market knowledge transactions among firms, institutions and human resources involved in this process. Innovation performance depends on the scope and efficiency of such transactions, themselves influenced by framework conditions governing capital, products and labour markets as well as by institutional set ups and policy actions addressing market and systemic failures specific to knowledge transactions. 3. Knowledge flows are fostered through complementary interactions in the innovation systems. Evidence shows that clusters are powerful systems in this respect, combining strong market-based capital and disembodied technology flows and competition-based incentives for innovation, as well as propensities for collaboration and co-operation and long lasting networking that are efficient for transferring tacit knowledge. In general, the complementary interactions also include those of different institutional forms. However, knowledge flows should not be seen isolated from necessary growth in knowledge endowments like investments in human capital or Research and Development. Dynamism arises from both growth and interactions. 4. Implementing the NIS framework implies a comprehensive perspective on policy design aiming at improving the overall configuration of the innovation system notably as regards the reallocation of financial support to Research and Development, incentives for collaboration among firms and between public and private institutions, reduction of regulatory obstacles that hinder mobility of human resources. 5. The implementation of the NIS framework should also be seen as a learning process that can lead to a reshaping of the policy-making system itself. Three key areas for attention are highlighted: First, comprehensive policies need to be organised in designated policy spaces to achieve best possible interactions between them and a best possible environment for innovators. Many countries currently reform their policy systems in this way. Policies should be co-ordinated through specific mechanisms ranging from loose mutual information to strategic integration at the government level or co-ordinated in a decentralised manner using for example regional bodies. Second, innovation governance should be as flexible as possible, building upon a division of labour between public and private sectors. In particular the regional level helps develop a more context-sensitive policy environment. Third, policy learning needs to be institutionalised, for example through dedicated evaluation schemes, learning mechanisms adapted to cycles or stages in the policy process. 6. Governments should use the NIS approach to learn about the intended and unintended consequences of their policies, and rest the implementation on political feasibility and consensus building.	national innovation systems *** human resources *** innovative firms *** human resources *** innovation process *** national innovation systems *** systemic failures *** framework conditions *** labour market *** innovation performance *** innovation systems *** knowledge flows *** tacit knowledge *** knowledge flows *** human resources *** innovation systems *** private sector *** regional level *** policy processes *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_human_resources *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)16	CASE STUDIES ON INNOVATION	2001	S	The present document takes into account comments and suggestions made at the TIP Bureau meeting and at the CSTP, as well as the main messages from the Vienna Workshop on Cluster-based Innovation Policies. The case studies would contribute to the analysis and development of concrete policy initiatives while providing further guidance for the implementation of a national innovation systems approach to innovation policy that can address the diversity of knowledge management patterns underlying the innovative performance of particular sectors  or technological fields. The proposed case studies would investigate the value chain of knowledge production, sharing, acquisition, and use in each technological field or sector, tracing the flows of knowledge among Research and Development- performing organisations in industry, government, and academia. They would identify the forces that influence the directions of research (e.g. new technological opportunities, environmental concerns, human health) and the research disciplines and industry sectors that are most actively engaged. Each case study will address a common set of core questions motivated by the three ongoing TIP projects and by the results of the NIS project. As a result, the work will allow general lessons to be derived and cross-sectoral comparisons to be made. A preliminary list of issues to address includes: Drivers of innovation, Characteristics of the innovation processes and systemic linkages, PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in pre-competitive technology development, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management in the public sector, Globalisation Role of chabadu chabados and new technology based firms, Innovation policies. a representative list of fields/industries to consider in case studies includes: Automobile industry, Software and related services, Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Energy, Environmental innovation.	national innovation systems *** technology fields *** innovation performance *** value chains *** knowledge flows *** technology fields *** business sector *** public sector *** technology development *** public private partnerships *** innovation process *** intellectual property *** new technologies *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** technology based firms *** environmental innovations	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)17	KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE SERVICE ACTIVITIES IN INNOVATION SYSTEMS - AUSTRALIAN PROPOSAL FOR A CASE STUDY	2001	S	In its work on innovation systems the TIP Group has not previously focused specifically on services issues, yet these are now recognised as increasingly important in modern economies. Many  OECD countries are taking a strong interest in business-related services, one of the most dynamic and fastest growing sectors in most developed economies. Business services and financial services alone, in many advanced countries, account for between a fifth and a third of total gross value added, in some cases equalling or surpassing the value added by manufacturing. The increasing interpenetration and complementarity of manufacturing and service production is an important characteristic of knowledge intensive economies, calling for more detailed analysis. Studies show that linking manufacturing and services is now a key competitive strategy for many firms. In particular, recent Australian work (undertaken by the AEGIS Group; Cook et al., 2001) indicates where knowledge-intensive services provided by others can be important to the success of that strategy in a range of industries. To explore these issues further, and clarify the policy implications, Australia proposes a new TIP project that would be undertaken through the work of a Focus Group. Over a three-year time-span, the project would investigate knowledge-intensive service activities in innovation systems at different levels, national, regional, sectoral, clusters, to build on and expand earlier studies, particularly TIPs work on innovation systems. Knowledge-intensive service activities (KISAs) are defined as service activities provided either internally or externally to a firm, in manufacturing or service sectors, in combination with manufactured outputs or as stand-alone services. The major aims of the project would be to generate a comparative analysis of different kinds of service inputs to the management of innovation in firms and to enhance the effectiveness of policy directions and delivery in government. The projects contribution to policy development will take place at three levels. It will: (i) Deliver essential background understanding and contribute to better informed discussion of dynamic relationships between manufacturing and service elements of the economy in a context of innovation systems-related policy to promote knowledge-based competitiveness. (ii) Assist in redressing the balance of innovation policies between Research and Development and other existing mechanisms for development so as to include encouragement of other modes of intra-firm and inter-firm learning-and-searching activity. (iii) Enable better assessment and evaluation of policy instruments from the standpoint of recognising and promoting services and service activities that contribute to the dynamics of innovation systems. Assessment will focus on government policy programs  which themselves adopt the form of knowledge-intensive services to firms. Aspects to be studied cover: (i) Types of interaction involving knowledge intensive service activity, Types of knowledge-intensive service activities, Specialisation within the broader focus,	innovation systems *** service industries *** knowledge intensive services *** knowledge intensive services *** service activities *** knowledge intensive services *** innovation systems *** service activities *** knowledge intensive services *** services sector *** innovative firms *** policy development *** innovation systems *** service activities *** innovation systems *** policy instruments *** policy evaluations *** knowledge intensive services *** knowledge intensive services *** service activities *** knowledge intensive services *** service activities *** knowledge intensive services *** innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_services *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)18	INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS -- STATUS REPORT	2001	P	The TIP project on Innovation and the Strategic Use of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs explores how public research organisations (PROs) are using their intellectual property (IP) to enhance the diffusion of research and the commercialisation of technology. In June 2001 the TIP set up a Focus Group on Innovation and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs. The first task of the Focus group was to design a survey about the patenting and licensing practices at public research organisations. The questionnaire was divided into two  parts: Part I is set of questions to government ministries on the legal framework for IP management at PROs and Part II is a mailed survey about the patenting and licensing activities of PROs to be sent to the managers of technology transfer organisations at PROs. Public research organisations, which for this project were defined as including: All research performing universities, both public and private; Research laboratories and agencies operated and fully funded by the government; Other research organisations that receive a significant share of their total funding from  public sources. Most OECD countries grant ownership of intellectual property rights generated by publicly- funded research to the performing institution. The information available on the impact of patenting and licensing practices on research and innovation at PROs is usually country specific. Moreover, the international comparability of results are limited by the focus of the surveys and/or the target audience. For example, most surveys are devoted to university-based PROs. This bias reflects in part the relative importance of university-based systems in the performance of government funded research relative to other types of PROs (non-university hospitals, laboratories, etc.). Previous OECD work has identified a typology of institutional arrangements for exploiting IP at PROs   along   three   main   models:   i) Dedicated   technology   transfer   offices   (on-site   or   off-site); ii) Administrative departments of the PRO whose main mission is not IP management and iii) external providers whether public or private of IP management services to PROs. From anecdotal evidence, it appears that a great number of PROs do not break-even in the short term on their IP activities. Common problem that PROs across the OECD face: insufficient financial resources and managerial resources for IP management combined with weak demand in the local market for IP.	research organisations *** technology commercialisation *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** technology transfer *** intellectual property *** research performance *** research organisations *** funded research *** intellectual property *** funded research *** institutional arrangements *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)19	COMPETITION AND CO-OPERATION IN INNOVATION	2001	R	1. Two seemingly opposite forces--competition and co-operation--increasingly drive technological innovation. Competition encourages innovation by involving firms in a race to increase market shares and gain first mover advantages. Co-operation allows firms to share the risks and costs of innovation, pooling resources for Research and Development, invention, and commercialisation through technology licensing, standards setting, collaborative Research and Development, joint ventures, or mergers and acquisitions. 2. The role of competition has long been recognised and is codified in competition policies that, among other features, guard against the abuse of monopoly power by dominant firms and against anti- competitive collusion among collaborating firms. The importance of co-operation has only more recently been recognised, reflecting rising Research and Development costs and the key role of networks in knowledge flows - including tacit knowledge - underpinning the innovation process. Not only have firms begun to co-operate more frequently in the innovation process, but also policy makers have begun to actively promote inter-firm collaboration and networking as a means of stimulating innovation and technology development. 3. Competition authorities around the world have generally asserted that they would not stand in the way of research joint ventures and other forms of collaboration at the research stage, as long as certain general conditions are met. In particular, collaboration is accepted as the most appropriate way to conduct  a range of so-called pre-competitive research, i.e., research that can effectively be used and shared by a number of industry participants, serving as a common base from which firms can later compete by developing their own specific products. Other forms of co-operation that may be used in other parts of the innovation process have not been as uniformly accepted, raising questions about the compatibility between competition policy and co-operative behaviour, especially in high-technology industries in which co-operation appears most prominent. 4. This paper examines competition issues associated with the more widespread use of co-operation in the innovation process. It reviews the factors that drive firms to co-operate to foster their innovation capacities and presents evidence of increasing inter-firm co-operation, especially in high-technology industries. It then explores different forms of co-operative behaviour, from loose forms of co-operation such as patent licenses to more tightly-coupled forms of co-operation, such as joint ventures and mergers to identify practices that could be interpreted as anti-competitive and to provide advise on how to review such cases. 5. As the paper demonstrates, co-operation and competition are not necessarily at odds, nor does one have to be traded-off against the other. Competition and co-operation can be used in complementary ways to boost innovation. Harmonised innovation policy frameworks can be created that take into account the dynamic character of innovation when evaluating the efficiency gains from co-operation against the potential risks of anti-competitive behaviour by co-operating firms. 6. For example, merger enforcement in high-technology industries can follow the same principles that apply for mergers in other industries, but with an emphasis on certain aspects of the analysis that may be less important in less dynamic industries. Concerns about innovation, rather than simply prices and   output, will be more important in industries where the consumer benefits derive largely from innovation and the resulting product improvements. Furthermore high-technology industries accentuate the usual problems associated with predicting future market conditions (either with or without a proposed merger). Finally, there may be considerable uncertainty about the scope and validity of intellectual property rights that are critical for market structure and competition. These challenges may make merger enforcement more difficult, but do not suggest that fundamental principles need to be changed. 7. Similarly, application of fundamental principles of competition law and economics can illuminate some of the competition challenges associated with other forms of co-operation:  Standard setting, an increasingly important form of co-operation in the information economy, raises two competition policy concerns: First, what are the limits on the co-operative activity permitted as part of the standard-setting process. Second, what are the limits on unilateral conduct that might allow a single firm to control and make proprietary a standard that would otherwise be open.  Cross-licenses of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and patent pools promote diffusion, even while enhancing the returns to innovation, but can however be abused and raise competition concerns when they reduce the ability of the licensees to compete against each other and increase their incentives to collude. In general, these practices can be highly pro-competitive as long as complementary and not substitute INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs are combined.  Mandatory licensing of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs remains the area where the tension between intellectual property rights and competition policy is most directly felt. Nonetheless, conditional licenses can have potentially more harmful effects on competition than unconditional refusals to license. Tying, the grant of a patent license conditional upon the licensee purchasing other products from the patent holder, is an example of such kind of restrictions and the main concern in current legal cases.  Even though the settlement of patent disputes can be pro-competitive, the possibility clearly exists for rivals to use the settlement process to restrict competition in ways not merely reflective of their valid intellectual rights. 8. Policy makers will need to remain vigilant to protect against these sorts of abuses of co- operation, some of which may be difficult to detect. Yet, the analysis demonstrates that pro-innovative forms of co-operation can generally be pursued within existing regulatory frameworks.	joint ventures *** technology commercialisation *** collaborative research and development *** competition policy *** innovation process *** tacit knowledge *** knowledge flows *** stimulating innovation *** innovation process *** technology development *** joint ventures *** innovation process *** competition policy *** innovation process *** innovation capacity *** joint ventures *** policy frameworks *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** technology co-operation	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)2	Programme of Work 2001-2002	2001	M	Proposed TIP activities for 2001-2002 are in line with the mandate notably as regards the contribution of technology and innovation to sustainable growth and employment. Increased attention should be given to the  policy implications of the NIS approach in terms of sectoral specialisation and competitiveness. 6 priority projects : (1) Implementing the NIS approach in policy making : This activity would provide an opportunity to discuss countries experiences in applying the NIS approach to actual policy making and benchmarking their innovation performance. Specific attention could be given to reviewing and comparing Member countries policies aiming at fostering innovation at a sectoral level. (2) Emerging Patterns of Public Support to and Private Investment in Research and Development : This activity will examine and assess emerging patterns of public support to industry. Specific attention  will be given to various forms of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS which are being implemented in many OECD countries, notably in the areas of generic technologies or at sectoral level. (3) Innovation and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT : This project should provide empirical evidence, notably based on sectoral case studies, of emerging  or novel licensing practices and the challenges and opportunities they create for knowledge creation and diffusion. (4) ICT, Innovation and Sustainable Development : It will examine the potential effects of increased development and diffusion of ICT related innovations on the use of raw materials, energy and transport in intermediary and final consumption and their implications in terms of the contribution of innovation policy in the achievement of sustainable development objectives. (5) Fostering Innovation in chabadu chabados : expand analysis on two aspects. First, it will identify good policy practices to improve access to and participation of chabadu chabados in government sponsored research and programmes. Second, as a contribution to the design of both Science and Technology and chabadu chabados policies, it will analyse the evolving contribution of chabadu chabados to Research and Development and innovation in different sectors and countries. (6) International Mobility of HRST: Emerging Trends and Policy Implications : this activity would deepen the analysis of the changing patterns and drivers of international mobility, including between advanced countries (intra-OECD) and the implications for innovation and technology policies.. Depending on resource availibility, 2 additional projects might be considered : (1) Innovation policies in a globalised world : Science and Technology and innovation policies can no longer de designed and implemented in a narrow national context. Rather, they need to be embedded into an international perspective so as to increase the capacity of economies to access  and exploit the results of global Science and Technology activities as well as to contribute to the global pool of knowledge. At the same time global framework conditions need to be put in place in areas such as INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs, rules governing public support to Science and Technology activities and openness to foreign investment and trade in Science and Technology intensive goods and services. (2) Technological foresight exercises : the TIP Group could provide value added to national foresight exercises in acting as  a clearing house for information and in assessing the contribution of foresight exercises in setting priorities for technology and innovation policies.	employment growth *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** national innovation systems *** fostering innovation *** research investments *** public private partnerships *** intellectual property *** sustainable development *** development and diffusion *** fostering innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** policy practices *** small and medium sized firms *** international mobility *** framework conditions *** foreign direct investment *** intellectual property *** foresight exercises *** priority setting	objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)20	OECD QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE PATENTING AND LICENSING ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS	2001	S	The purpose of the questionnaire is to help policy makers in the OECD understand the type and scope of the patenting and licensing activities of public research organisations. The information from this survey may help governments evaluate current policies regarding the allocation of ownership of intellectual property in public research, the infrastructure support to public research organisations for technology transfer activities, the incentives for public sector researchers to pursue commercialisation of their inventions, and/or the establishment of safeguards to protect access to public research results. The questionnaire is divided into two sections which differ in terms of target audience for the questions and the methods for obtaining answers. Part I.  Questions to Government Ministries: Questions about national, regional, or institutional policies regarding the ownership and use of intellectual property at public research organisations. These questions should be answered by government ministries or from relevant government documents. Part II.  Mailed Survey to TTO Managers at PROs: A mailed survey to be answered by TTO managers.	research organisations *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** public research results *** technology transfer *** public research sector *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** research organisations	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)21	MAPPING THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGICAL FIELDS OR SECTORS. A BIBLIOMETRIC APPROACH	2001	R	1. The proposed case studies on innovation will require a sound empirical basis to characterise innovation processes in selected technological fields or sectors [DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)16]. Bibliometric indicators  measurements of scientific publications and patenting activity  are increasingly used for that purpose because they provide unique insight into the nature of knowledge production and diffusion. By focusing on outputs of innovative activity, they complement other, more traditional means of measuring innovation, which are based on measures of inputs to the innovation process, such as Research and Development expenditures, scientific and engineering personnel. 2. This document describes the main analytical benefits of using bibliometric indicators. It presents the general concepts and the methodological problems of investigating Science and Technology activities by means of quantitative indicators derived from Research and Development data, innovation surveys and bibliometric data. It then describes in greater detail the kinds of indicators that can be developed using bibliometric data and their applications in the field of space communications in a way of example. Finally, the document outlines particular issues associated with the implementation of a bibliometric approach to the proposed case studies. Bibliometric indicators in context 3. There are four basic requirements to be considered in choosing quantitative indicators to examine the economics of knowledge production and diffusion in specific technological fields or sectors (Barr, 1997): 1. International comparability. The comparison between countries or regions is now at the heart of most studies on knowledge production and diffusion. This reduces the value of case studies based on ad hoc data that do not allow such comparisons. 2. Capturing the dynamics of knowledge production and diffusion at micro-level. As shown by the NIS Focus Groups on innovative networks and clusters, the knowledge base of different economic activities and knowledge linkages among them are complex and changing constantly. The use of conventional statistical categories such as industry sector may lead to overlook key policy-relevant aspects of such change, in both retrospective and prospective analysis. 3. Measuring inputs, outputs and processes. Innovation itself is difficult to measure directly. Relating measures of the inputs to innovation (e.g. Research and Development expenditures) to measures of the output from innovation (e.g. patents, market shares in high-tech products) often requires some measure of innovation processes themselves (e.g. percentage of innovative firms, science-industry linkages). 4. Timeliness of data.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)3	PATTERNS OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FINANCING OF Research and Development: ISSUES AND A PROJECT PLAN	2001	S	Considerable evidence indicates that business strategies for research and development (Research and Development) have changed significantly in recent years. Available statistics show not only a rapid expansion in business funding for Research and Development in the late 1990s (growing 25% in the OECD between 1994 and 1998), but also marked increases in the amount of Research and Development conducted by small and medium-sized enterprises, the share of Research and Development conducted in the ICT and service sectors, the numbers of Research and Development alliances and mergers and acquisitions entered into by firms, and patenting and licensing activity. these data suggest that firms have adopted new models of knowledge creation, management, and sharing that supplement more strategically oriented internal Research and Development activities with external sources of knowledge and Research and Development. relationships with competitors, suppliers, start-up companies, universities, and public laboratories are being used to provide broader scientific and technological expertise to the innovation process. The growing levels of business Research and Development compared to publicly funded Research and Development imply that the private sector exerts greater influence over national innovation systems and that governments must better leverage their more limited resources to improve national innovative performance. Unfortunately Standard indicators of Research and Development funding and performance do not indicate changing strategies. This paper outlines a proposed project to better understand changing business strategies for Research and Development and their implications for chabadi chabado. This project will explore issues in five general areas:  (1) changing business strategies for Research and Development (Restructuring of internal Research and Development activities; Strengthening external linkages; Collaborative Research and Development; Patenting and licensing, chabadu chabados.). (2) globalisation of Research and Development and innovative activity (Many firms have also established Research and Development facilities in overseas markets. Traditionally, such investments were made in order to allow firms to better tailor products to local market needs. More recently, investments in foreign Research and Development facilities appear to have been made to gain access to international centres of knowledge creation);  3) the implications of these changes upon business innovation (it is not clear what the effect of changing patterns of private sector Research and Development has been on the innovation process. Debates ensued throughout the 1990s over whether or not the restructuring of internal Research and Development efforts in business would reduce support for long-term research and undermine innovative capabilities in the long run) .(4) the  ways  government  policy  can  adapt  to  changing  models  of  business  Research and Development (Levels of government funding for Research and Development; Basic versus applied research; Whom to fund? What to fund  and how to make allocation decisions? Mechanisms for financing business Research and Development). (5) measurement issues and indicators (development of indicators of industrial innovation. many leading innovators currently use a variety of approaches to monitor and benchmark their innovation processes with the aim of improving their management and outcome. Some opportunities may exist for leveraging such efforts to create better innovation indicators for policy makers). The output of this project is expected to take several forms. An issues paper (review existing data regarding private-and public-sector funding of Research and Development and other indicators of emerging patterns of innovation.), A workshop summary. A final summary paper that draws upon the resources of the TIP that relates the changing strategies for business Research and Development to public policy. The paper will attempt to identify policies to: 1) facilitate a shift toward a more transaction-oriented pattern of business Research and Development in lagging countries; and 2) identify ways in which Science and Technology policies can be better adapted to the new model of business Research and Development in leading countries	business strategies *** services sector *** international research *** business models *** research and development activities *** innovation process *** innovation performance *** funded research *** business research and development *** private sector *** national innovation systems *** business strategies *** international research *** small and medium sized firms *** business strategies *** research and development activities *** collaborative research and development *** globalisation of research *** innovation activities *** private sector *** innovation process *** business innovation *** international research *** applied research *** business research and development *** industrial innovation *** innovation process *** business research and development *** business research and development *** business models	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)4	INNOVATION AND STRATEGIC USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  ISSUES PAPER	2001	R	1. In OECD countries, the institutions that are involved in research and development (Research and Development) are much more conscious of the potential value of their intellectual assets than they were even ten years ago. Far before it leads to novel products and processes, intellectual property (IP) is now understood to be a valuable, tradable commodity. For this reason, public research organisations (PROs) have become more strategic in protecting and exploiting their research results and intellectual creations. Whenever existing or future intellectual assets are at stake  in collaborations and co-operative research, in contract research, in the transfer of materials or the use of equipment, for example  transactions with PROs increasingly involve legal negotiations about INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs. And since the development of new products and processes often requires the bundling together many pieces of intellectual property, reaching multiple agreements over the transfer or sharing of intellectual property can be time consuming and expensive. 2. The impact of this new strategic approach to INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs on the cost, efficiency, and direction of research is as yet unclear. Strategic IP behaviour includes decisions to formally protect ideas or innovations, the choice of licensing strategy, the decision to oppose or litigate in order to maximise ones rights or minimise those of competitors, as well as the development of co-operative strategies to maintain access to external knowledge and technologies. This change in behaviour can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on research and development. The benefits for public research organisations include increased licensing and royalty revenues, contract research funding, and spin-off formation. These trends have been documented for a number of OECD countries (OECD 2001a, 2001b). There are also intangible benefits to reputation and quality of research that more interactions with the private sector may generate. Indeed governments frequently encourage PROs to take a more commercial approach to intellectual property management through various supporting policies (e.g., strengthening and broadening IP regimes, administrative reforms for universities and PROs, subsidies for technology transfer). (For more detail see OECD, 2000). 3. The evolution of patenting and licensing behaviours has, nevertheless, raised a number of issues.1 In the most general terms, the concerns directly related to PROs include the impact of new licensing practices on access to research results and resources; on collaborations; on the costs of performing research and its efficiency; on the orientation and objectives of research; and on personnel relations. As tensions on the public research system emerge, governments are wondering if they should try to counterbalance the trend toward ever more active protection of property rights. Data on the actual IP practices of firms and institutions would help governments determine whether the present system of protection presents real problems for either science or commercial innovation, and what types of public measures are indeed warranted. The project on Innovation and the Strategic Use of Intellectual Property was suggested at the CSTP meeting in October 2000 and individual TIP and BIO contributions were approved by the CSTP in March 2001.2 The TIP project explores how strategies for the protection and exploitation of IP are evolving in PROs, and how this trend is influencing research, development, and the commercialisation of innovative new products or processes.3 The OECD added value lies in providing empirical evidence and case studies of emerging licensing practices and the challenges and opportunities these create. This information is important for improving policy design and implementation. To date, little is known about how common different licensing practices are, under what circumstances they are necessary and beneficial, or alternatively when they are thought to delay scientific progress, co-operation, and new product development.	intellectual assets *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** research results *** intellectual assets *** intellectual property *** contract research *** intellectual property *** new products *** intellectual property *** technological knowledge *** funded research *** research organisations *** contract research *** spin-off formation *** private sector *** intellectual property *** technology transfer *** research performance *** research results *** public research *** research system *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** new products *** product development *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)5	PROJECT ON PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION	2001	S	Important conclusions of the OECD Growth project are that: 1) innovation is an increasingly important contributor to sustainable economic growth; 2) a high rate of complementary public and private investments in Research and Development is a prerequisite for sustained innovation performance; 3) ensuring such complementarity requires that governments be responsive to the rapid transformation of innovation processes and related business needs and strategies; 4) a greater use of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (Public Private Partnerships) can increase this responsiveness, and thus enhance the efficiency of technology and innovation policy. Public Private Partnerships organise the co-operation between the public sector (e.g. government agencies or laboratories, universities) and the private sector (usually firm consortia, but also venture capital) in undertaking joint projects (research, development of Science and Technology infrastructure, human resource development) in areas where they have mutual or complementary interests but lack capabilities and incentives to act efficiently alone. Examples of such programmes include the Advanced Technology Programme (ATP) and Co-operative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) in the United States, the Rseaux de Recherche et dInnovation Technologiques in France, BMBF Research and Development Support in Germany, Co-operative Research Centre Grants in Australia. Public/private partnership is not a new but an increasingly popular approach in innovation policy because it has the potential to increase the leverage of public support to business Research and Development, through cost and risk sharing, as well as to improve the articulation between mission-oriented and market-oriented Research and Development to the benefit of both. In comparison with traditional Research and Development subsidisation policies, efficient Public Private Partnerships are characterised by a more competitive selection of private participants, increased influence from the private sector on project selection and management. In comparison with traditional procurement and technology transfer policies, Public Private Partnerships can ensure a higher-quality contribution by the private sector to government mission-oriented Research and Development and open new avenues for commercial spillovers from public research. In addition, Public Private Partnerships can be designed to achieve several goals at once (e.g. supporting pre-competitive research, building networks/linkages), which contribute to their systemic efficiency. However Public Private Partnerships have given rise to controversies in some countries, as illustrated by the recurrent debate on ATP in the United States. The main concern is that they may allow government to unnecessarily interfere with private initiative, if they are not precisely targeted at real market and systemic failures and  are not properly designed and run. Regarding design, institutional and contractual arrangements in a Public Private Parnership must ensure that: i) the best projects, from a both a social and private perspective, will be chosen; ii) the appropriate private partners will be selected, with due consideration for the need to promote wider participation of chabadu chabados in innovation networks; iii) an optimal sharing of costs, risks and rewards among private   and   public   partners   will   be   found,  avoiding   unnecessary   government   expenditure;   and iv) opportunistic behaviour will be discouraged and all partners will invest the necessary quality and quantity of resources. Regarding implementation, an important issue is that Public Private Partnerships challenge the managerial capabilities of government. To be a reliable partner of the private sector in co-operative ventures it may have to change the way ministries and agencies operate and develop new competencies in the public sector. The variety of national Public Private Partnerships programmes in terms of their size, objectives and design features, and the national specificity of their policy context have so far hampered an assessment of critical factors of success in Public Private Partnerships, based on international experience. This project should contribute to fill that gap at a time when Member countries are encouraged to exploit further the potential of Public Private Partnerships as a key instrument  of their technology and innovation policy. Its main objectives will be to: (i) Document current trends in Public Private Partnerships for innovation in the OECD area, and identify novel forms of co-operation between the public and private sector. (ii) Identify the critical factors (e.g. selection and nature of participants, financial engineering, incentive structure, critical mass, foreign and chabadu chabados participation) determining the efficiency of Public Private Partnerships for different types of policy objectives and in different technological areas. (iii) Derive practical lessons for national policies and international co-operation.	innovation performance *** economic growth *** innovation process *** public private partnerships *** research investments *** public sector *** public private partnerships *** venture capital *** human resources *** private sector *** supporting research and development *** business research and development *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** public research *** mission-oriented research *** public private partnerships *** technology transfer *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** systemic failures *** small and medium sized firms *** private partnerships in sti *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** public sector *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** small and medium sized firms *** public private partnerships *** incentive structures *** international co-operation *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)7	STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS -RENEWAL OF TIP MANDATE	2001	M	A Working Group is hereby established to undertake relevant tasks referred to in the Communiqu of the 1992 meeting of the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy at Ministerial level [SG/PRESS(92)21] and considering the Conclusions of the 1999 CSTP Ministerial [PAC/NEWS (99) 68], namely: (1) To improve the mutual understanding of national innovation systems and within this conceptual framework, the evaluation of national science and technology support systems (including generic technology policies) in order to facilitate the benchmarking and identification of best practice policies and their international implications. (2) To identify mechanisms and instruments for promoting the translation of scientific and technological knowledge from public and private research, into greater productivity, employment and sustainable economic growth, taking into account social, human resource, and environmental aspects. (3) To consider ways of encouraging international technological co-operation in the analysis, formulation and implementation of policy, including among Non-Member countries. In undertaking these tasks, the Group will explore new approaches to innovation and technology policy and the need for improving multilateral instruments. The Group will undertake its work in close co-operation with other relevant bodies of the Organisation and other international organisations in order to increase the benefits of their respective activities and to avoid duplication of effort.	national innovation systems *** policy practices *** best practices *** business research and development *** human resources *** economic growth *** technological knowledge *** policy implementation *** international technology co-operation	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)7	STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS	2001	M	Growth is not the result of a single policy or institutional arrangement, but of a comprehensive and co-ordinated set of actions to create the right conditions for future change and innovation. Continued work by the OECD is necessary to help governments establish the right set of policy measures and to develop framework conditions conducive to innovation and growth. To a large extent, the concept of National Innovation Systems has underpinned most of TIPs analytical and policy work on the relationship between innovation and economic performance. Now the TIP work is at the cross road of identifying and providing appropriate mechanisms  (good practice, benchmarking) for helping Member countries to translate into concrete policy action the substantial results of the activities carried out in recent years. 6 orientations are privileged. (1) Implementation of the NIS approach and the recommendations of the Growth report in policy making, (2) Comparing national responses to globalisation, (3) Comparing national visions of the future, (4) NIS and sustainable growth, (5) Globalisation, innovation and policy, (6) Public Support to and Private Investment in Research and Development: New patterns and policy implications	national innovation systems *** policy practices *** best practices *** business research and development *** human resources *** economic growth *** technological knowledge *** policy implementation *** international technology co-operation	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2001)8	INNOVATION IN TECHNOLOGICAL FIELDS AND SECTORS PROPOSED CASE STUDIES	2001	S	At its June 2001 meeting, the TIP Group agreed that its future work orientations should include a stronger emphasis on sectoral dimensions of technology and innovation policy. This document proposes a set of five industry case studies that would feed into existing elements of the programme of work. The case studies would investigate the degree to which policy-relevant differences exist in the innovation patterns of different technological fields/industries. The proposed case studies would investigate the value chain of knowledge production, sharing, acquisition, and use in each technological field or industry sector, tracing the intellectual contributions and flows of knowledge among Research and Development-performing organisations in industry, government, and academia. A preliminary list of issues to address includes: Drivers of innovation, Research and Development funding and organisation, and characteristics of the innovation processes, PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in pre-competitive technology development, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management in the public sector, Globalisation, Role of chabadu chabados and new technology based firms. Five case studies would be conducted that focus on technology fields/sectors where publicly funded research plays a significant role in the innovation process: Automobile industry, Software and related services, Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Environmental innovation. Although the case studies will assess a common set of issues, they are expected to highlight both the similarities and differences in the innovation processes among the examined sectors and to provide relevant input to the on-going TIP projects. For example, the case study on automobiles will address the effect of globalisation on innovation strategies, especially on the location and organisation of Research and Development. The case study on software and related services will emphasise the relationships among software developers, systems integrators, and end-users in developing new technology. Work on pharmaceutical biotechnology will highlight the contribution of university-based spin-offs and new technology based firms and the challenges in developing licensing policies that protect the interests of both industry and the  science system. The case study on nanotechnology will examine the challenges in organising multidisciplinary research in a nascent (and still somewhat undefined) technological field, as well as issues related to international co-operation in publicly funded research. The environmental case study(ies) will investigate innovation patterns in a field motivated by societal concerns as much as by technological opportunity, draws upon a number of different academic disciplines, and contributes to numerous industry sectors. The case studies will be undertaken by the Secretariat with the help of consultants and the  support from Delegations.	technology fields *** value chains *** business sector *** technology fields *** knowledge flows *** small and medium sized firms *** public sector *** intellectual property *** innovation process *** public private partnerships *** technology development *** intellectual property *** new technologies *** technology based firms *** funded research *** environmental innovations *** innovation process *** technology fields *** innovation process *** research organisations *** new technologies *** new technologies *** science system *** technology based firms *** funded research *** international co-operation *** technology fields *** business sector *** technology fields	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)1	CASE STUDIES IN INNOVATION: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES	2002	P	The objectives of the project on Case Studies in Innovation are twofold: (i) To develop cross-country analytical work aiming at improving the understanding of innovation processes in specific technology fields or sectors within the overall framework of national innovation systems. (ii) To draw policy conclusions as regards the balance between horizontal innovation policies and more customised measures that take into account the specific characteristics of innovation processes in selected technology fields or sectors. Such policy conclusions should concern in particular patterns of Research and Development funding of the various institutions involved in fostering innovation, patterns of co-operation among such institutions (e.g. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS) and framework conditions that affect innovation performance (e.g. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs, competition, regulations). The technology fields/sectors selected for the case studies are energy, pharmaceutical biotechnology and knowledge intensive service activities (KISA).  The common core of case studies should comprise two components. The first one consists of an analysis of the main characteristics the innovation system. The second investigates the systemic linkages and weaknesses that affect the performance of the innovation system and derives possible policy implications.	innovation process *** technology fields *** national innovation systems *** innovation process *** technology fields *** horizontal innovation policies *** fostering innovation *** innovation performance *** public private partnerships *** framework conditions *** intellectual property *** knowledge intensive services *** technology fields *** service activities *** innovation systems *** innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** other_policy_areas *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)10	PROGRESS REPORT OF THE TIP CASE STUDY IN INNOVATION IN KNOWLEDGE INTENSIVE SERVICE ACTIVITIES (KISA)	2002	P	Knowledge Intensive Service Activities (KISA) are defined for the purpose of this project as the activities involved in the use of innovation services provided either internally or externally to a firm or organisation, whether in the manufacturing or service sectors. The KISA focus group met for the first time in Paris in June 2002. At that meeting it  was  decided that the group would analyse four industries or clusters. The participant countries decided that the first two industries would be common so to allow for cross-country analysis. These industries are software and health care.	service activities *** knowledge intensive services *** innovation in services *** services sector *** health care *** service activities *** knowledge intensive services	policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)11	PROGRESS REPORT ON TIP/IEA CASE STUDY ON INNOVATION IN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY	2002	P	The Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy (TIP) is co-operating with the IEAs Committee on Energy Research and Technology (CERT) on a case study of innovation in the energy sector. While many details of the implementation plan must still be worked  out,  key  decisions  have  been  taken  regarding  1) the  contributions  of  participating  countries, 2) specific technologies to be investigated in greater detail, 3) the analytical framework to be used in characterising the innovation system, and 4) quantitative data analysis that will support other, more qualitative aspects of the study. Many countries expressed interest in fuel cells. The case study on innovation in energy technology will use as the basis of its analytical framework the list of topics outlined in the revised energy sector proposal: Drivers of innovation; Knowledge creation, diffusion, and exploitation; Public Private Partnerships; Intellectual property rights; Effects of globalization; Systemic influences on innovation. In addition, the group will include a module that examines the realised or potential social and economic returns from investments in energy Research and Development and innovation. It will categorise these benefits in keeping with a taxonomy developed by the U.S. National Research Council. This study identifies economic, environmental, social and national security benefits of energy innovations, distinguishing among benefits that have been realised (i.e., the technology has been deployed with visible benefits), benefits that accrue through an expanded set of technological options for addressing energy needs, and knowledge benefits.	energy sector *** innovation systems *** fuel cells *** energy technology *** public private partnerships *** intellectual property *** energy sector *** energy technology	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)12	PROGRESS REPORT OF THE TIP CASE STUDY IN INNOVATION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY	2002	P	Can we identify important differences and similarities in the structure and dynamics of national biotech innovation systems of the participating countries which explain the performances of these systems, and what are the policy implications? This was elaborated into a set of issues: What systemic failures are responsible for a sub-optimal performance o the pharmaceutical/medical biotechnology innovation system, especially in the business system? Is there a relation between the openness of a national innovation system and its performance, and if so, how open should the system be when performance maximisation is pursued? What specific demand-side factors influence the biotechnology innovation processes and what are the effects on the innovation outcomes? What elements of framework conditions and horizontal innovation policies are key to foster innovation? To what extent and how should innovation policies be customed to the particular needs and features of the features of the biomedical/biopharmaceutical innovation system? Structure and dynamics should be analysed. Structure relates in particular to the different types, numbers and roles/contributions of actors and institutions in the innovation system and the way they are linked to each other. These can be found in: (a) The biotechnology Research and Development system (i.e. the knowledge value chain) e.g. universities, government research institutes, start-ups and successful young biotechnology companies, multinational companies, academic hospitals, clinical research organisations etc. (b) The biotechnology business system (i.e. the production value chain) e.g. multinational companies, medium-sized and large pharmaceutical companies, clinical research organisations, dedicated biotechnology firms, suppliers of intermediates, service delivery firms, etc. and (c) The (institutional) environment, e.g. public bodies (e.g. for policies, stimulation programmes, laws and regulations), venture capitalists and informal investors, business support organisations (e.g. for legal/INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT matters, incubator facilities etc), consumer and patient organisations, insurance companies etc. (System) Dynamics especially relate to the following aspects: (a) Changes in the structure and composition of the innovation system (e.g. due to firms entering or leaving the business and Research and Development systems, mergers, acquisitions, diversifications, bankrupts, etc) over time. (b) Changes in linkages between actors (e.g. a shift from local Research and Development co-operations and clusters to international networks) over time. (c) Changes in the institutional environment (e.g. new government and public biotechnology policies, introduction of new laws and regulations, increasing public resistance, improving entrepreneurial climate, etc) over time. (d) New scientific/technological developments and innovations (e.g. genomics). (d) The occurrence of critical events (e.g. 9/11/02, food scandals, etc).	innovation systems *** systemic failures *** innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** innovation process *** framework conditions *** horizontal innovation policies *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** value chains *** research organisations *** research organisations *** value chains *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** innovation systems *** business research and development *** technology development	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)13	Nanotechnology Research and Development Programmes in the United States, Japan, and the European Union: A Preliminary Review	2002	S	Recent years have seen nanotechnology become a priority in science and technology (Science and Technology) policy in many countries, as well as a new target for Research and Development efforts. More than 30 countries have launched public Research and Development initiatives in this field. While the major economies have undertaken broad Research and Development initiatives covering promising applications in electronics, materials and life sciences, smaller countries have tended to specialise their Research and Development efforts in more limited areas. Nanotechnology is also attracting private Research and Development investment. Several large, multinational firms are engaged in nano-scale research, and venture  capital funds are being established to finance the growth of new nano-based start-up companies. Interest in nano-science and technology stems from its potentially wide range of applications and significant social and economic benefits. Nanotechnology is likely to affect nearly all economic and industrial sectors in one way or another and to give rise in the medium and long terms to the emergence of  a range of new activities. Estimates of future markets for nanotechnology-based products and services vary widely, but range up to USD 1 trillion by 2015. This paper provides a preliminary examination of national Research and Development initiatives that have been launched in the field of nanotechnology. It provides a brief review of the major elements of nanoscience and technology and of projected market applications. It then provides basic statistical information on Research and Development funding, scientific publications, and patenting in related fields. Finally, the paper outlines the main features of the public nanotechnology Research and Development programs in the United States, Japan, and the European Union, describing their primary objectives and the institutional actors.	public research and development *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** business sector *** scientific publications *** development programmes	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)14	PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION COUNTRY NOTES FOR PEER REVIEW	2002	S	The OECD Growth Study identified four drivers of growth in the knowledge-based economy   (i.e. seizing the benefits of ICT, fostering innovation and technology diffusion, enhancing human capital and realising its potential and fostering firm creation and entrepreneurship) and made related policy recommendations. CSTP and the TIP working party will discuss papers about fostering innovation and technology diffusion. The project consists of two parts: a top-down analysis and a bottom-up peer-review process. The purpose of the top-down analysis is to identify effective micro-policies for stimulating growth.  The exercise has three steps, for each of the drivers of growth: (1) identification of top performing countries on the basis of the available indicators and other qualitative information; (2) identification of relevant policy domains; (3) identification of effective micro-policies for each of the relevant policy domains. Currently, these three steps have been completed for fostering firm creation and entrepreneurship, while the process has been engaged for the module on fostering innovation and technology diffusion. The purpose of the peer-review process is to produce substantial cross-country references that  can serve as a useful, practical guide to countries considering policy reform in certain policy domains. The peer-review will be much more specific than the benchmarking exercise in its recommendations and only one policy domain for each of the drivers is selected for the peer review process. This process is well advanced for venture capital, the policy domain that has been chosen for fostering firm creation and entrepreneurship. It should now start for PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for research, the domain chosen for fostering innovation and technology diffusion. The exercise will have four steps: (i) A paper that defines the relevant policy domain and proposes a framework for a comparative analysis of country practices. (ii) The OECD Secretariat suggests a list of possible countries for the review process and countries volunteer to be part of the process: At recent CIBE and CSTP meetings, Australia and the Netherlands volunteered to be reviewed; France and Austria also agreed, subject to confirmation. Other countries have expressed interest, such as Denmark, Norway and Sweden. (iii) Country note for peer reviews are prepared according to the agreed framework and the peer review process is conducted under the aegis of the TIP, with participation of CIBE experts. This process involves the following steps: Draft country notes  including basic facts, tentative policy assessment and open questions  would be prepared by participating countries, in co-operation with the Secretariat. A series of interviews with major stakeholders, based on the draft country note, would be organised in each participating country. A final version of the country note would be subsequently prepared. Peer-Review based on country notes to be held in the framework of TIP meetings in June and December 2003. The draft country notes will be revised in light of the discussion during the Review and resubmitted to the TIP for approval before being declassified. (iv) Once a sufficient number of countries have been reviewed, a cross-country synthesis paper is prepared with a view to identifying policy benchmarks.	knowledge-based economy *** technology diffusion *** fostering innovation *** technology diffusion *** fostering innovation *** policy domain *** technology diffusion *** fostering innovation *** policy domain *** peer review *** policy domain *** venture capital *** policy domain *** public private partnerships *** technology diffusion *** fostering innovation *** policy domain *** peer review *** peer review *** public private partnerships	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)15/PART1	CASE STUDIES ON MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AT PUBLIC RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS IN OECD COUNTRIES	2002	R	1. The romantic idea of innovation as the result of the creative efforts of the isolated individual inventor that succeeds in putting successfully a new product or process on the market is foregone. Innovation is now generally accepted as the result of various actors (PROs, firms, intermediary institutions, etc.) that jointly and quite often in competition, interact to not only create new knowledge, but to diffuse this knowledge and translate this in competitive goods, services and processes. In this so-called systemic notion of innovation, the relations between industry and sciences and more specifically the management of knowledge transfer in both directions are generally perceived as being at the core an innovation system (defined at whatever level). INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs as a key framework condition for innovation 2. Further, it is increasingly acknowledged that providing the right framework conditions, in addition to more direct policies aimed at increasing innovation and ISRs or knowledge transfer, is as much needed for facilitating innovation. This can range for example from more tangible factors such as the availability and quality of the financial infrastructure, electronic infrastructures, standard setting and normalisation as well as factors that are harder to grasp such as entrepreneurial culture, innovation governance structures, trust-factor in the political-economic system. In attempts to increase the social returns from investments made in publicly funded research the policies towards INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT are an important frameworks condition. In most OECD countries this coincides or follows an increased awareness and quite often rethinking of IP management issues, both by industry as well as Public Research Organisations (PROs), inducing a trend towards more active management of IP or intellectual asset management, including a further institutionalisation of it. At PROs this is for example reflected in the activities of dedicated Technology Transfer Offices (TTO) or TTO-officers. Case studies provide the story behind the figures 3. Many OECD countries have enacted or are considering policy changes regarding the ownership, management and exploitation of IP arising from publicly funded research. Many PROs are actively reformulating their IP strategies. The OECD IP policy survey as well as the OECD survey among TTO- officers have for the first time, for a many OECD member countries, mapped the state of affairs regarding IP policies and IP practices in general and towards publicly financed research as performed by PROs in particular1.  1. The outcome of the surveys and the analysis based thereon are reported separately (see OECD, 2003).   4. The 11 case studies from 10 countries reported in this volume provide the policy stories behind the figures and are aimed at furthering insight into how PROs actually shape INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT strategies and how policy-makers steer and facilitate this process. They offer the possibility to improve the understanding of national specificities in approaches to managing IP at PROs e.g. by dealing more extensively with:  The institutional variety among PROs and approaches to IP management that goes with it.  The policy mixes used, partly as a result of how IP rights were arranged for historically.  Specific changes in IP policies and the sort of trade offs made in these policy processes.  The practical difficulties in actually implementing these new policies by setting up of new TTO-structures, working with new kinds of standard contracts, changing the mindset of individual researchers. 5. Further, some of the case studies delve into more focussed topics such as:  How is dealt with IP in vanguard fields such as biotechnology or biomedical technology.  How is IP management shaped in individual PROs.  How are IP policies developing in an economy in transition.  What is the role of IP-based spin off as one of the many channels available for technology transfer.  How are incentive structures for individual researchers developing. 6. The remainder of this report presents the case studies for review by TIP Delegates. A separate synthesis chapter is under preparation and will presented to the TIP as a Room Document (No. 3). While the synthesis is being prepared, one conclusion that can already be drawn from the many case studies is that there is a tremendous scope for mutual learning. However, as the case studies also illustrate, the institutional set ups, the magnitude of research funding, the research culture and history, the extent of industry-science relationships as well as technological specialisation, are all very country specific and therefore copying ready-made solutions found elsewhere is most likely to lead to policy failure.	new knowledge *** knowledge transfer *** innovation systems *** intellectual property *** framework conditions *** knowledge transfer *** governance arrangements *** funded research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** technology transfer *** funded research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** policy mix *** policy processes *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** technology transfer *** incentive structures *** funded research *** industry-science relationships *** intellectual property *** research organisations	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)16/REV1	TARGETING Research and Development: ECONOMIC AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF INCREASING Research and Development SPENDING	2002	R	69. As this paper shows, achieving Research and Development targets  which typically implies significant increases in Research and Development intensity over a relatively short period of time  entail significant social and economic reform. While often viewed as a financial objective and an input that will drive economic growth, the process of meeting Research and Development targets implies changes in the structure of industry (e.g. toward high-technology sectors), in  the   governance of public research (e.g. to improve quality and establish centres of excellence), and in the nature of the labour force (i.e., to increase the number of highly skilled workers and researchers). Implementing such changes can require policy initiatives across a broad range of domains, from Research and Development funding and entrepreneurship to immigration and education policy, to product, financial and labour market regulation. Such structural reforms can make achieving Research and Development targets much more difficult than they may appear on the surface and must be considered in policy debates regarding chabadi chabado.   Box 1. Hitting a moving target: The case of Canada The challenges of meeting Research and Development targets are even more difficult in the case of countries that attempt to reach not an absolute Research and Development intensity but a certain level of performance relative to other countries. Canada, for example, has identified a goal of becoming one of the most innovative countries in the world by setting a target of increasing its Research and Development intensity. Rather that specifying a particular Research and Development intensity level as the EU has done, it has set the goal of becoming the 5th highest Research and Development intensive country across the OECD by 2010, up from its current position of 14th out of OECDs 30 Member countries (Government of Canada, 2001). Achieving an ordinal Research and Development target of the type Canada has set is harder to achieve than hitting an established 3% target because with so many countries trying to boost their Research and Development intensity, the target is moving upward. Over the past two decades, there has been improvement in the Research and Development intensity of OECD countries. Even with the recession of countries after 1981 (many of which had relatively low Research and Development intensities), the average Research and Development intensity increased from 2.0 to 2.3 between 1981 and 1990 before declining to 2.2% in 2000. Whereas the top 5 countries had Research and Development intensities between 2.2 and 2.5% in 1981, they had Research and Development intensities between 2.7 and 2.8 in 1990 and between 2.7 and 3.8 in 2000 (Box Table 1). The list of countries in the top 5 also changed significantly, with only the Sweden and the United States appearing on all three lists. The growth in Research and Development intensity across the OECD implies that countries must invest more in Research and Development just to keep their existing ranking. This is seen in Canada as well where even though Canadas position in the OECD rank is unchanged between 1996 and 2000, the Research and Development intensity needed to maintain this position increased from 1.69 to 1.84. But the situation is made more complex by the fact that the fastest growth in Research and Development intensities in recent years has been at the top of the scale. Since Research and Development intensities began recovering from a relative nadir in 1994, the largest percentage point growth in Research and Development intensity occurred in Finland, Iceland, Japan and Sweden, each of which had relatively high levels of Research and Development intensity in 1994. Some countries with low Research and Development intensity (Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Italy) saw Research and Development intensity decline even further by 2000, increasing the differences among OECD countries. In short, the distribution of countries Research and Development intensity has become more skewed over time. Such a distribution both presents a challenge for Canada since reaching the top-end has become harder, but also an opportunity, since Canadas current position is almost exactly the median of the OECD ranking. This means that it will be relatively easy for Canada to move up from its current position since 6 countries are within 0.2 percentage points of its current position. Given that both the numerator and dominator factor into the calculation, it is relatively sensitive indicator of performance. Also, official statistics are subject to revision and a certain level of imprecision  thus not too much economic meaning should be given to a shift in position of 5 or even 6 places placing Canada in the top-10. A jump of 9 places to the top-5 is much harder, but not impossible: between 1991 and 2000, Finland climbed 6 places, and Korea climbed 5 to be ranked numbers 2 and 5 respectively. Iceland jumped from number 21 to number 4 over the decade, with significant increases in industry- and government-financed Research and Development. These precedents suggest that Canada could meet its target. But unlike Finland which is a 6th the size (GDP and population) and Iceland which is a 100th the size, Canada is a medium-sized country where rapid movements are more difficult mathematically. Korea is of the same relative size, but Canadas natural endowments and close interdependence with the US mean that a radical restructuring of the industrial mix of Canada is unlikely. Its proximity to the US may, however, make it an attractive location for foreign affiliates to conduct Research and Development. Already, foreign affiliates represent over a third of all business Research and Development in Canada. Also, Canada enjoys a heritage of being an immigration-based country, making it a potentially attractive destination for foreign highly-skilled researchers. Nevertheless, the jump from the current position of 14th with a Research and Development intensity lower than that of the EU (1.84 vs. 1.88) to number 5 would require at a minimum that Canada raise its Research and Development intensity to the level now enjoyed by number 5, the US, of 2.72.	development targets *** research and development intensity *** development targets *** economic growth *** public research *** labour market *** development targets *** development targets *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** business research and development *** research and development intensity	objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)16/REV1	TARGETING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: ECONOMIC AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF INCREASING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING	2008	R	Recent years have seen an increasing number of national and regional governments establish explicit targets for levels of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT spending. These targets are often expressed as a goal of increasing gross expenditures on RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (GERD) to a specified level of GDP (i.e., RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT intensity) by a specified year, or as achieving a specific ranking among OECD countries in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT intensity. little analysis has examined the upstream effects of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT targeting. What kinds of structural and regulatory changes are necessary to boost RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT spending sufficiently to meet established? What is the likely effect of such targets on the public and private-sector RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT performers? What are the implications for human resources and on the geographic distribution of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT? This paper examines the policy implications of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT targeting at the national and regional levels. achieving high-levels of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT intensity in the EU as well as in other countries and economic regions  will require addressing many structural reforms. It will require reform in three different but linked policy areas: 1) improving the environment for innovative businesses, 2) enhancing the ability of public research organisations (government laboratories and universities) to serve as sources of industrially-relevant, fundamental research; and 3) cultivating, attracting and retaining high-skilled workers. In addition, policy makers need to consider how RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT spending targets interact with other policies and social priorities. As this paper shows, achieving RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT targets  which typically implies significant increases in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT intensity over a relatively short period of time  entail significant social and economic reform. While often viewed as a financial objective and an input that will drive economic growth, the process of meeting RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT targets implies changes in the structure of industry (e.g. toward high-technology sectors), in the governance of public research (e.g. to improve quality and establish centres of excellence), and in the nature of the labour force (i.e., to increase the number of highly skilled workers and researchers). Implementing such changes can require policy initiatives across a broad range of domains, from RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT funding and entrepreneurship to immigration and education policy, to product, financial and labour market regulation. Such structural reforms can make achieving RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT targets much more difficult than they may appear on the surface and must be considered in policy debates regarding chabadi chabado.	development targets *** research and development intensity *** development targets *** economic growth *** public research *** labour market *** development targets *** development targets *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** research and development intensity *** business research and development *** research and development intensity	objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)17	WORKSHOP ON ASSESSING NATIONAL INNOVATION PERFORMANCE	2002	W2	The aim of the workshop is to explore issues around the assessment of innovation performance, including the development and use of quantitative and qualitative innovation indicators, with a view to assist the CSTP discuss its contribution to the follow up of the OECD growth study. Specifically, drawing upon the insights of the National Innovation Systems approach, the workshop will contribute to identifying: effective methodologies for evaluating countries innovation performance; the limits to adopting an quantitative indicator only based approach and where qualitative tools may be more insightful and appropriate; the mix of approaches that could be used by policy makers to gain a representative picture of innovation performance. Issues. The Innovation System is a systematic description of all those factors, influences, actors, institutions, organisations and linkages that affect the level and nature of innovation within a country. Since many of the determinants of innovation are institutions, laws, cultural characteristics, customs etc. that are distinguishable at the national level and because innovation policy is largely set by national governments the focus is normally on the National Innovation System (NIS). However it is sometimes appropriate to focus on regional innovation systems or on innovation systems that cover adjacent regions  of several different countries. It is also important to recognise that the determinants of innovation at any particular geographical location are increasingly global in nature. Despite the above qualifications national governments will be first and foremost concerned with the performance of their NIS. Although each NIS has in own particular characteristics the problems faced and the methods available to assess national innovation performance are broadly similar across countries. This provides scope for OECD countries to learn from one anothers assessments and makes it useful to compare innovation performance of countries that are at a comparable stage of economic and social development. Caution must be exercised in such cross-country comparisons because: The underlying structure of a countrys innovation system cannot be fully captured using standard assessment procedures and indicators. The set of available indicators provide a less than complete coverage of the innovation process and the factors which determine innovation.There is probably more than one configuration of a NIS which can result in a high economic and socially beneficial rate of innovation. The links between innovation and economic performance and social well-being can only be imperfectly modelled. These considerations make it impossible to satisfactorily compare the innovation performance of two countries by simply adding together the scores achieved against a standard list of characteristics. However providing these caveats are observed it is possible for member countries to have very useful discussions about how national innovation performance may be assessed. The objective of the workshop is, to allows for presentations by two invited experts on comparative assessment of National Innovation Systems. It also allows for three member country presentations including one by the UK. Currently we are carrying out a full assessment of UK innovation performance as part of a policy review. Country presentations should not only cover the results of their assessment of innovation performance but in addition address the main methodological issues encountered.	innovation performance *** national innovation systems *** countrys innovation performance *** innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation performance *** countrys innovation performance *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** innovation performance *** innovation performance *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** innovation performance *** innovation performance	objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)3	PROPOSED CASE STUDY ON INNOVATION AND Research and Development PRODUCTIVITY IN THE ENERGY SECTOR	2002	S	The energy sector has been transformed in profound ways in recent years. First, due largely to deregulation and other market forces, today energy industries operate in a much more competitive environment than before. This is particularly true of the electric power industry, but it is also true of the oil and natural gas industries. Second, as in many other industries, information technologies (IT) have transformed the way all energy industries do business in fundamental ways and made major contributions to productivity gains in these industries. Third, the growing concerns about global climate change, and the fact that close to 90% of green house gas emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels, have shifted much of the recent energy Research and Development toward lowering emissions of green house gases, in particular CO2. The purpose of this case study is to perform a systematic evaluation of these (and other) changes that have transformed the energy sector and assess their impacts - individual and joint  on innovation processes, Research and Development productivity, and their policy implications. Cross-country and cross-industry comparisons of Research and Development productivity in the energy sector, in particular in the context of the recent regulatory reform, IT revolution, and environmental considerations would be important to the members in their formulation of reasoned energy and environmental policy. for the case study to be useful for policy purposes, it should cover at least four key energy industries  oil, natural gas, coal, and electric power. For each industry, the study will investigate how and to what extent the regulatory reform, IT, and environmental concerns have affected their innovation system and the productivity of their Research and Development. This scope restricts the analysis more narrowly than the overall productivity effects of IT; it addresses how IT affects the innovation process and the adoption and deployment of new technologies. Depending on the size and composition of the focus group, each member will perform the study for all four industries, or select a subset of the industries as appropriate. Specifically, for each energy industry, the study will: (i) Analyse the industry-specific innovation system; (ii) Evaluate the recent trends in: Regulatory reform, Adoption of IT, Environmental concerns. And (iii) Assess the impacts on the innovation system, and Research and Development productivity	energy sector *** information technology *** product development *** innovation process *** energy sector *** product development *** regulatory reform *** energy sector *** environmental policy *** regulatory reform *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** new technologies *** regulatory reform *** innovation systems *** product development *** innovation systems *** product development *** energy sector	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)4	PROPOSED CASE STUDY ON INNOVATION IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY	2002	S	The Netherlands and Norway propose to co-lead a case study on innovation in pharmaceutical biotechnology. This is a fast-growing technological field where evolving arrangements for Research and Development between public research, biotechnology start-ups and major pharmaceutical companies drive the commercialisation of new health-related biotechnologies such as diagnostics and therapeutic applications. The links between scientific discoveries and commercial products are tight, and protection of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT is paramount in the strategies of large and small firms alike, raising a number of issues in the licensing of public research results. Social forces also drive innovation, whether by creating incentives for cures for particular diseases or by motivating production of low-cost drugs for use in developing countries. In addition, the skeptical attitude among wider society as well as the role of regulation makes this innovation system an interesting case-study. (ii) Interaction: Industry-Science relations; Entry and exit barriers; Type of relationships (Durability vs. flexibility, Exclusive vs. non-exclusive, Role of producers, users, suppliers, specialised knowledge supplier, Role of networks (PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS); Role of chabadu chabados and new technological based firms. (iii) Financial environment: Banking system; Risk aversion vs. risk seeking; Availability of venture capital. (iv) Appropriability conditions: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management; Patterns of licensing (Mix of exclusive vs. non-exclusive licences, Use of patents). (v) Demand Conditions: Public acceptance (ethical norms etc.); Homogenous vs. heterogeneous; Advanced vs. standard; Size & growth.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)5	INTERIM RESULTS OF THE TIP PROJECT ON THE STRATEGIC USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs AT PROs	2002	R	This document presents the interim results of the TIP Project on the Strategic Use of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs, in particular the results of the OECD questionnaire on the Patenting and Licensing Activities of PROs implemented by Focus Group on Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights (led by the Netherlands and the United States) between Fall 2001 and Spring 2002. Legal Frameworks for IP at PROs. Across the OECD area governments are implementing changes to patent and employment laws and/or to research funding regulations to grant PROs title over inventions arising from publicly funded research, emulating a US policy change in 1980. Ownership gives PROs control over their IP, provides legal certainty, and fosters technology transfer and public/private research partnerships. Transaction costs and risks of litigation are higher when individual inventors at PROs own the IP, potentially slowing technology transfer. Policies on ownership of non-patented IP, including copyrightable works, such as software or databases, are not well documented or diffused by PROs in a number of OECD countries. Similarly, rules on the ownership of IP by students and other non-employees at university-based PROs are lacking or unclear in several countries. Joint ownership of IP resulting by industry-sponsored research is in the main determined by contract law but PROs are more likely to retain title and control over a patent in exchange for providing firms with exclusive licenses than to assign ownership of IP to firms. One of the main impacts of specific legislation on ownership of IP at PROs has been to raise awareness and support for technology transfer, especially within the hierarchy of PROs, and among researchers. Trends in PRO Patenting and Licensing: The stock of patents at technology transfer offices (TTOs) range from less than ten patents on average in some countries, to a few dozen patents. Non-university public research organisations seem to be slightly more active in patenting than universities, especially in European countries. The range of patent applications ranged from the low single digits to, in exceptional cases, a couple hundred patent applications. Patents are filed mainly domestically but overseas patents are important. Given the relatively small size of their IP portfolios, most TTOs negotiate a very small number of licenses (often less than ten) per year. PROs tend to license inventions to small domestic firms, although large domestic firms do not trail far behind. Licenses to other PROs are rare. Platform inventions that can lead to a range of commercial applications are more likely to be commercialised via spin-offs than licensed. Consequently, the number of spin-offs per TTO is quite low, in most cases less than 1 spin-off or start-up created per year except in the US where the figure is 2 per year since the end of the 1990s. The licenses negotiated often include some form of limited exclusivity (e.g. by territory or field). Less common but still important are clauses in licensing agreements that require the licensee to make good faith efforts to exploit the invention, or to grant the PRO reach through royalties or rights of first refusal on future inventions. Despite the upswing in PRO IP activities, to date they have not been heavily involved in infringement litigation. PROs are slightly more likely to sue a third party for infringement than to be sued. Next Steps: The information and data on which this interim report is based is still incomplete and many countries still carrying out follow-work. As such, the findings in this report should be interpreted with caution. The results nevertheless provide a good sense of the type of empirical evidence that can be collected on how public Research and Development performing institutions are using their intellectual property. The Focus Group will hold Workshop in The Hague on 17 October to validate the survey results and draw policy conclusions from the project in preparation of the final report for the CSTP.	intellectual property *** funded research *** business research and development *** technology transfer *** technology transfer *** technology transfer *** technology transfer *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** public research and development *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)7	PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION	2002	R	2. Important conclusions of the OECD Growth project are that: 1) innovation is an increasingly important contributor to sustainable economic growth; 2) a high rate of complementary public and private investments in Research and Development is a prerequisite for sustained innovation performance; 3) ensuring such complementarity requires that governments be responsive to the rapid transformation of innovation processes and related business needs and strategies; 4) a greater use of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS can increase this responsiveness, and thus enhance the efficiency of technology and innovation policy. 3. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (Public Private Partnerships) for innovation organise the co-operation between the public sector (e.g. government agencies or laboratories, universities) and the private sector in joining forces in areas where they have mutual or complementary interests but deem that they lack capabilities and incentives to act as efficiently alone (research, development of Science and Technology infrastructure, human resource development). While Public Private Partnerships are not new, they are an increasingly popular approach in innovation policy and takes new forms in the pursuit of evolving objectives in a changing economic environment. 4. Increasing the Public Private Parnership component of innovation policy has the potential to improve the leverage of public support to business Research and Development, through cost and risk sharing, as well as to improve the articulation between mission-oriented and market-oriented Research and Development to the benefit of both. Public Private Partnerships can ensure a higher-quality contribution by the private sector to government mission-oriented Research and Development and open new avenues for commercial spillovers from public research. In addition, Public Private Partnerships can be designed to achieve several goals at once (e.g. supporting pre-competitive research, building networks/linkages), which contribute to their systemic efficiency. However, the variety of Public Private Parnership programmes in terms of their size, objectives and design features, and the national specificity of their policy context have so far hampered an assessment of critical factors of success in Public Private Partnerships, based on international experience. 5. The TIP project on Public Private Partnerships is intended to contribute to filling that gap. Its main objectives is to i) document current trends in Public Private Partnerships for innovation in the OECD area; ii) identify the critical factors determining the efficiency of Public Private Partnerships for different types of policy objectives and in different technological areas, and iii) derive practical lessons for national policies and international co-operation.	innovation process *** public private partnerships *** research investments *** economic growth *** innovation performance *** public private partnerships *** public sector *** human resources *** private sector *** new forms of innovation *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** business research and development *** public research *** public private partnerships *** mission-oriented research *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** international co-operation *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)9	NIS POLICY ASSESSMENT: IMPLEMENTATION OF HORIZONTAL INNOVATION POLICY PROPOSAL FOR A NEW TIP ACTIVITY AND FOCUS GROUP	2002	S	Recent work in the OECD stressed that the NIS approach is not about designing optimal structures, but to ensure the vitality and adaptability of the innovation system. Hence, governments need to continuously promote dynamic changes in their innovation systems through policies that are responsive to the changing needs of users while promoting sound, long-term economic and institutional developments. The implications will vary from country to country, reflecting enduring international differences in technological specialization and institutional set-ups, including variation in public funding of Research and Development, basic research in universities, industry-science relationships, venture capital and labor markets. What is of common interest, however, is to develop national capabilities in strategic management of a coherent innovation policy. In practice, this concerns mostly some key government ministries as well as national agencies responsible for funding projects and managing innovation-oriented programmes and initiatives. Leaving the challenge with policy implementing agencies alone will certainly not provide any guarantee against putting square pegs in round holes, since the effectiveness of  and returns from science and technology investments will rest more than before on characteristics of the rest of the system. For example, commercialisation of public Research and Development might be heavily dependent on institutional regulations governing the universities and the academic labor market. Hence, the objective of the proposed focus group will be to help TIP learn from national efforts to develop capabilities for an efficient innovation policy governance. More precisely, this will involve drawing lessons from selected national experiences to improve the understanding of: (a) How different policies interact to create the basis of an horizontal innovation policy, taking into account the path dependency resulting from national traditions. (b) How to coordinate policies across institutional boundaries through inter-ministerial collaboration and institutional mechanisms for policy learning within and between agencies  and ministries. (c) The key national capabilities, including in the areas of goal setting and evaluation, that are required for effective processes of policy formulation, co-ordination and implementation, as well as for the management of transition processes in complex innovation systems.The synthesis report from the last phase of the NIS project identifies a comprehensive set of dimensions that needs to be taken into consideration in defining a coherent horizontal innovation policy. The Nordic countries initiated a collaborative process in which they tried to use this framework to benchmark their national policy profiles. Preliminary outcomes from this work illustrates that the national profiles are highly different. One lesson from the Nordic activity is that there is still much room for improving international comparisons of innovation policy profiles, including the innovation components of non-S/T policies. The focus group will both follow up on the Nordic benchmarking initiative and deepen the analysis of selected dimensions of the benchmarking framework, by focusing on four dimensions of the national capabilities to manage a coherent and adaptive innovation policy: Policy analysis and evaluation; Agenda setting and prioritization; Implementation; Transition management (here understood as the ways in which complex changes are managed through comprehensive policy packages and their strategic implementation. This includes the renewal of innovation governance structures themselves). It is suggested that the work be organized along the following work packages: (i) Benchmarking national profiles of innovation policy, (ii) Case studies of selected policy areas (Sustainable development, Coordinated innovation policies for the information society); (iii) A synthesis analysis: The purpose will be to identify new models  of  institutional arrangements and practices for collaboration and co-operation. Implementing the NIS approach is demanding for governments in that it challenges the traditional modes of operation associated with linear model regimes. To master complexity and interactions, governments and their agencies need to develop new co-operation and communication practices that enable policies to be designed with the interests of many stakeholders and institutional groups in mind. The analysis should therefore investigate member countries recent efforts to create these new institutional arrangements and to find work modes that enable them to cut across institutional boundaries, ensure effective policy learning and build- up collective capabilities for policy coherence. More precisely, this work package should focus on: Identification of governance processes related to the above mentioned elements of transition management; Analysis of the efficiency, coverage and transition management capability of the governance system as the change agent; Analysis of structural and cultural factors affecting system capabilities.	innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** innovation systems *** venture capital *** industry-science relationships *** basic research *** public research and development *** governance arrangements *** policy formulation *** innovation systems *** transition management *** policy profiles *** policy profiles *** transition management *** governance arrangements *** sustainable development *** policy areas *** institutional arrangements *** business models *** national innovation systems *** institutional arrangements *** transition management	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges

DSTI/STP/TIP(2002)9/REV1	MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTING HORIZONTAL INNOVATION POLICY: PROPOSAL FOR A NEW TIP ACTIVITY (MONIT)	2002	S	The objective is to help the members of the TIP working group to learn from efforts to develop national capabilities for innovation policy governance. This will involve drawing lessons from selected national experiences to improve the understanding of: How national traditions and contexts generate and sustain policy orientations and mixes; How different policies interact to create a basis for developing horizontal policy; How to co-ordinate policies across institutional boundaries through inter-ministerial collaboration and institutional mechanisms for policy learning within and between agencies and ministries; The key national capabilities for effective processes of policy formulation, co-ordination and implementation as well as for the management of transition processes in complex innovation systems. These capabilities include those of evaluation and identifying policy needs. It is suggested that the work be organized along the following work packages: WP 1Profiling national innovation policy. It aims at giving a more comprehensive view of the current situation in national priorities and strategies, and the key reforms and decisions that formed the policy profiles over time. WP 2 Case studies of selected horizontal policy areas. These studies will illustrate how the definition and deployment of core S/T policies are co-ordinated with other policies. It is suggested that the work package cover one mandatory case study (on efforts to implement co-ordinated innovation policies for the information society) and at least one freely chosen within the following policy areas: Sustainable development, Regional policy, Transport policy. WP 3, Synthesis and policy conclusions: These activities will lead to a synthetic analysis of new models and practices of institutional arrangements for collaboration and co-operation in policy formulation. This work package should focus on: Identification of governance processes related to the above mentioned elements of transition management. Analysis of the efficiency, coverage and transition management capability of the governance system as the change agent. Analysis of structural and cultural factors affecting system capabilities. Understanding the link between the institutional design of policy and results/effectiveness in the various countries. The foreseen outcome of this work is to arrive at policy implications for developing national capabilities that include the key dimensions of: Agenda setting and prioritization, Implementation, Policy analysis and evaluation, Transition management.	governance arrangements *** transition management *** policy formulation *** innovation systems *** policy profiles *** policy areas *** policy areas *** sustainable development *** policy formulation *** business models *** institutional arrangements *** transition management *** transition management *** transition management	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI/STP/TIP(2003)11	KNOWLEDGE INTENSIVE SERVICE ACTIVITIES IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY Draft synthesis report of TIP innovation case study on KISA: Software module	2003	P	This report focuses on available results of the KISA study in the software industry from empirical studies conducted in Australia, Norway, Ireland and Korea. Ongoing research in Finland and New Zealand will contribute to the final KISA report on the software industry. PART 1 Overview of the software industry. Data was collected on national statistics of the category computer and related activities, broader than software, as most countries do not gather data on software alone. The data presented herein thus provide a broader picture than that of the software sector alone but one that is important to understanding the activities of software firms. The study found through the statistics that the software industry had grown considerably in the participating countries and the number of firms has increased overall. The computer and related activities sector contributes significantly to many economies in terms of GDP, growth and employment and the growth of production and employment in the sector has been faster than the cross-sector average in most OECD countries. The sector has a greater share of GDP than a decade ago. The great majority of software firms in OECD countries are very small, with 80-90% employing less than five persons. Interestingly, however, the market share of the larger companies in terms of turnover and personnel is higher than expected. Firms in the sector have many highly skilled personnel. They invest heavily in research and development and their propensity to do so has also steadily increased over recent decades. Finnish and Norwegian innovation studies provided evidence that more than 50% of firms produced products new to the market, (radical innovations) while firms in other countries, such as Australia, emphasised incremental changes. The most important sources of innovation knowledge are internal to the firms, while clients or customers are the second most important. PART B Policies and programmes for the development of KISA in the software industry. Most participating countries have some government programmes supporting the software and ICT industries. Korea and Australia also have some government programmes specifically supporting the software industry. Korea enacted the Software Industry Promotion Act in 1987, which included basic guiding principles on software program development and promotion, legal framework and funding, and has a software promotion committee. Until September 2003, Australia had a programme oriented towards the diffusion of new knowledge within the software industry, the Software Engineering Quality Centres Program. This programme was designed to increase the competitiveness and technological sophistication of the software industry in Australia. At the same time, the majority of innovation support programmes in participating countries appear to be generic, promoting innovation across sectors, and very few programmes are specifically aimed at the development of KISA. Nevertheless, some of these policies and programmes, either industry-specific or generic, might have an indirect influence on the development of KISA in the software industry. PART C: Inside the software firm: an analysis of KISA. There are some significant differences in the innovation processes in software firms in the participating countries. While Ireland identifies processes of innovation such as creation of new products, new processes, design and re-design, the adaptation of products and the adaptation of processes, most firms in Australia see their innovation as primarily consisting of incremental changes, that is giving their products an improved or additional functionality and a better performance ratio. In contrast, the great majority of surveyed firms in Norway assess their innovations as quite radical or very radical. Many of their products are new to the world market while other products are either new to the Norwegian market or constitute radical technical solutions, graphic interface or scaling possibilities. Funding of innovation comes largely from inside the firms, especially in Norway, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. The majority of firms surveyed were small or very small, with generally less than 10 employees, and their main product lines were software applications.  Most countries mentioned customers as critical innovation partners (Norway, Finland and Australia). Australian firms, for example, report that it is the client experience with the product that provides the insight that can then be incorporated in the next phase of product development for future releases. In this way customers assist firms through involvement in the supply of marketing and technical information and in the testing and validation of products. Thus customer relations are seen as critical to innovation. Other critical innovation actors in Finland were institutions, subcontractors and other active partners in the software networks. The Korean case study shows that CSS suppliers regard information within the firm or inter-firms, as the most important sources of innovation and so formal strategic alliances with suppliers and competitors are the preferred innovation partnership. The following activities were identified as KISA-related to the software industry by the participant countries: i) strategic development advice; ii) employment-related services; iii) IT- related services (training, technical consulting, development advice); iv) management and consultancy services; v) IP-related services; vi) Research and Development services; and vii) marketing services. These activities can be sourced in-house or from external knowledge-intensive service providers. The study found that the great majority of firms preferred to keep most KISA sources in-house. Examples of KISA of high importance and core competency for the majority of the firms are IP related services, Research and Development services and software marketing services. Overall, KISA were mainly sourced internally and sometimes as a mix of external and internal services. The principal exception was legal and accountancy services that were  sourced externally in all participant countries. In general, KISA were considered important to build and maintain the innovation capability of software firms. The specific contribution of KISA to innovation was found to depend on the expectations that the particular activity played in the firm. For example, Norway found evidence that external KISA would significantly contribute to innovation when the firm had planned the activity to acquire and adapt new knowledge and when the external KISA providers changed the working methods and the way of doing things in terms of the delivery of the activity. It is in this interaction with external providers that the activity becomes of more value to firms and when the mix of KISA takes place. Finland mapped KISA across the lifecycle of a product and found that IT support services and business consulting are most frequently used. In addition, Finnish firms use all or most types of KISA during the professional management and the expansion period of the lifecycle of the firm. Three principal innovation challenges identified by the majority of firms in Norway, Ireland, and Australia were: lack of innovation funding, excessive economic risk and high innovation costs. In addition, Norwegian firms found lack of time, lack of qualified personnel and market related hindrances as added barriers to the innovation process. Time constraints were perceived as the most important obstacle to innovation as the pressure from everyday work is too great. The supply of the right people is also seen as a constant problem when searching for technical specialists but also for personnel with good sales and marketing skills.  Ireland and Australia found that copyright is the most common form of intellectual property protection used by software firms. Trademarks were used by more than one third of firms but more than half of the firms do not use patents as a protection method. Informal methods such as secrecy, complexity of design and speed to market were used frequently in both countries as a form of protection. Licensing was important both as a cost and as a source of revenue for firms. The development of open-source software will have significant effects in this regard. The majority of countries found the public sector (programmes and agencies) beneficial to some extent in supporting KISA in the software sector. Use of government funding programmes by software firms was very limited in Korea, whereas 44% in Australia and near 50% of Irish software firms did access government grants. In Korea the CSS suppliers identify the research and development service by the government as important to their innovation. Most firms regarded the role of the public sector as significant.	software industry *** software industry *** software industry *** software industry *** software industry *** employment growth *** software industry *** development programmes *** software industry *** government programmes *** software industry *** government programmes *** software industry *** new knowledge *** software industry *** software industry *** support innovation *** support programmes *** software industry *** software industry *** innovation process *** innovation process *** new products *** product development *** software industry *** knowledge intensive services *** innovation capacity *** software industry *** new knowledge *** innovation process *** intellectual property *** software industry *** public sector *** software industry *** public sector *** knowledge intensive services *** software industry *** service activities	policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP(2003)4	A STRATEGIC VIEW OF INNOVATION POLICY: A PROPOSED METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING INNOVATION POLICY AND PERFORMANCE	2003	R	1. As part of its efforts to follow-up on the OECD Growth study, the Committee on Industry and the Business Environment (CIBE) is conducting a project to identify micro-policies for Growth and Productivity, with a focus on four policy areas: i) seizing the benefits of ICT, ii) enhancing human capital and realising its potential, iii) fostering firm creation and entrepreneurship, and iv) harnessing innovation (OECD, 2001a; 2001b). As with the other modules, the innovation module has the objective of going beyond the broad policy conclusions of the Growth Project to identify effective micro-policies for harnessing the potential of innovation and technology diffusion, based on examination of policy implementation in OECD countries (OECD, 2002d). The work combines a top-down approach which aims to summarise effective innovation policies in selected areas with bottom-up analyses through peer reviews that provide more detail on specific micro-policies.1 2. At its meeting in March 2003, the CSTP discussed ways of improving upon the methodology originally proposed for the top down component of the innovation module, which assesses innovative performance using a quantitative benchmarking framework and identifies good policy practices (policy benchmarks) by examining practices in top-performing countries, as determined by a composite indicator of innovative performance. Taking into account the discussions at the London Workshop on Evaluating Innovation Performance, held on 25 March and their previous of work on innovation policy, delegates highlighted the need to combine qualitative and quantitative information in assessing innovation performance and to consider the effectiveness of policies in the specific economic and institutional context in which they operate. Delegates indicated that the Secretariat should, in consultation with Mr. Barber, former chairman of the CSTP, develop a revised methodology for the innovation module that would use a mix of qualitative information and quantitative indicators to assess innovation performance, and that would examine the relationship between innovation policy and performance in a limited set of OECD of countries that present a range of different experiences in the structure of their innovation systems and in their ability to translate innovative inputs into economic and social outputs [DSTI/STP/M(2003)1]. They further indicated that this work should take into account country specificities in terms of institutional settings and technological specialization in understanding the effectiveness of innovation policy instruments. . 3. This document represents the first phase of this work. It outlines a proposed methodology for assessing national innovation performance in the context of the micro-drivers of growth and productivity study and the role that such an assessment can play in a strategic or top-down approach to the making of innovation policy. It is intended to guide a second phase of work that would include preparation of a paper that presents the results of the analysis outlined herein. In line with earlier work by the TIP Working Party and following the discussion at the London workshop, this document recommends that the assessment of innovation performance be conducted within a national innovation systems (NIS) framework using a variety of quantitative indicators and qualitative information and analysis. It further indicates that national innovation performance needs to be set in the context in of economic and social change, of the direction and pace of scientific and technological change and of developments in the world economy at large. A key element in the assessment is the ability of individual actors such as firms and of the system as a whole to adapt to such changes. The document then considers how a systems approach to national innovation performance can be used to formulate a strategic or top-down innovation policy. Assessment of national innovation performance (e.g., through international benchmarking) is only one of the knowledge inputs required by policy-makers; the document briefly describes the others and how they need to be combined in order to construct a mix of policies, programmes and instruments appropriate for the country concerned. It contrasts the top down approach to innovation policy with a bottom-up approach and argues that successful policy making must involve elements of both. 4. The document proposes that the second phase of work on the innovation module proceed with four to six Member countries preparing accounts of their own innovation performance along the lines set out below. The selected countries should offer a range of interesting lessons for innovation policy based on differences in the apparent structure and capabilities of their innovation systems and on the different challenges they face in ensuring that such systems efficiently contribute to economic and social benefits. These countries should also be asked to show how their innovation performance assessment relates to the overall stance of the countrys innovation and RTD policy, as well as to specific policy instruments used. The countries should span a range of innovation systems and performance so that the suggested approach can be tested against a range of circumstances and conditions. The results of these country studies would be analysed and synthesised into a final report, an interim draft of which could be presented to the CIBE and CSTP at their autumn 2003 meetings.	policy areas *** business environment *** technology diffusion *** policy implementation *** peer review *** innovation performance *** policy practices *** innovation performance *** innovation performance *** innovation systems *** policy instruments *** innovation performance *** innovation performance *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** technological change *** innovation performance *** innovation performance *** policy mix *** innovation performance *** innovation systems *** innovation performance *** policy instruments *** innovation systems	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2003)5	WORKING MEETING ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR INFLUENCING BUSINESS Research and Development STRATEGIES. REPORT.	2003	W2	Following a proposal made at the December 2002 meeting of the TIP Working Party, the IWT (Flanders) and OECD organized a one-day working meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, 4 February 2003 to discuss future activities to evaluate the effects  and effectiveness  of government policies for stimulating business Research and Development. Such work is seen as a logical successor to the TIP project on Emerging Patterns of Public and Private Financing of Business Research and Development, interim results of which were presented in workshops organized by the OECD and the Austrian tip group in 2001-2002, and which has focused to date on documenting changing business strategies for Research and Development and their implications for chabadi chabado. TIP delegates suggested that future work attempt to investigate how governments can improve the effectiveness of individual instruments and the mix of policies used to support business Research and Development and innovation. While considerable analytical work has been conducted on evaluation of Research and Development and innovation policies, much of this work has estimated the amount of additional business Research and Development funding stimulated by government incentives, a concept known as input additionality. There is growing recognition of the need to better understand how  and how well  different types of policy instruments influence the behaviour of firms in planning and conducting Research and Development, a concept referred to as behavioural additionality. The working meeting provided an opportunity for participants to voice their interests in better understanding behavioural additionality of national innovation policies, to discuss current or planned activities in this area, and to explore opportunities for harmonizing further empirical work on this topic. Participants expressed considerable interest in such work and saw considerable opportunities for mutual learning from international co-operation on evaluation techniques. There was general agreement to pursue a two-pronged strategy: Pilot study to evaluate the behavioural additionality of government Research and Development subsidies. A small number of countries that are prepared to launch studies in the near term agreed to co-ordinate  their efforts to develop and implement a survey for measuring the behavioural additionality of direct funding of business Research and Development. This work will be led by Belgium (Flanders) and will include contributions from several other countries. More comprehensive evaluation effort. A larger group of countries will simultaneously begin to consider other options for examining the effectiveness of government innovation policies. This would include work to better understand the interactions between the public and private sectors in the innovation process and to lay the theoretical foundations for subsequent studies of behavioural additionality. These two elements are closely interlinked. The results of the pilot study can inform development of the larger, co-ordinated effort; similarly, the larger set of interested countries can act as an expert group to advise the pilot study and related evaluation activities (e.g., helping to refine the methodology and to interpret the results). Participants agreed to meet again in May 2003, in the context of the Vienna conference on Evaluation of Government-funded Research and Development Activities, to discuss evolving work plans. Work resulting from these activities will be reported to the TIP at its meeting in June 2003 for further discussion and consideration.	business research and development *** business research and development *** business strategies *** business research and development *** policy mix *** business research and development *** evaluation of research *** behavioural additionality *** policy instruments *** behavioural additionality *** international co-operation *** behavioural additionality *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** private sector *** innovation process *** funded research *** research and development activities *** business research and development *** development strategies	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** internationalisation_globalisation *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2003)6	OVERVIEW OF RECENT TRENDS IN PATENT REGIMES IN UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND EUROPE	2003	R	1. Patent regimes have gone through important changes in the past two decades, most of them in the direction of strengthening patent rights, in the sense of reinforcing the exclusive rights conferred to patent holders and expanding their coverage. OECD countries have experienced an upward harmonisation of their patent regimes based on the generalised belief that easily enforceable patents and broader rights for patent holders are beneficial for innovation. Reforms have been mainly led by requirements set out in international treaties, and decisions taken at major patent offices and courts. 2. The main factors underlying these reforms have been as follows:  Greater recognition that intellectual property drives innovation and growth. The conventional wisdom that has driven policy changes in recent years considers patents as an essential instrument to foster Research and Development investment and economic growth.  Emergence of new governing bodies. The design and enforcement of patent policies has lain increasingly in the hands of international organisations such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), major patent offices (JPO, USPTO and EPO) and courts specialised in Intellectual Property Rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs) issues, such as the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).  International harmonisation of patent regimes. Upward harmonisation of patent laws across countries, including developing countries, mainly since the inclusion of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs as an essential issue in international trade negotiations at WTO (TRIPS, 1995). 3. And their effect on the patent system has been characterised by:  An extended coverage of patent protection. Areas that used to be outside the realm of patents are now increasingly protected, notably as regards service-type inventions (e.g. software and business methods). Inventions are more frequently based on the results of basic research, especially in the field of biotechnology (e.g. genetic inventions), and public research organisations increasingly patent and license their inventions. In addition, minor inventions that would not qualify for patent protection can be now protected by weaker forms of protection known as 'petty patents' or 'utility models' in an increasing number of countries.  Patents have become increasingly robust. In the US, the rate of invalidation of patents substantially decreased since the creation of the CAFC in 1982. The creation of the European Patent Office as the centralised granting authority upgraded the legal status of European patents by introducing examination and opposition procedures.  Patent holders are entitled with broader rights. Patent claims in new areas often cover much more than what the inventor actually discovered or invented, due to patenting practices (e.g. reach through claims in biotechnology) and also probably due to the difficulty faced by patent examiners to identify overly broad claims in areas with short patent history. Moreover, the   conditions to apply research exemptions have become increasingly restrictive and authorities rarely mandate compulsory licensing.  Filing procedures are increasingly flexible. Several mechanisms to defer filing and examination procedures at patent offices, such as the system introduced by the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), have transformed the initial application in a sort of 'option to patent' that allows inventors to retain the right to patent in foreign countries for longer periods of time.  Efforts to reduce the cost of filing for patents, notably at an international level. These include the introduction of the PCT system, a substantial reduction of EPO fees, and the announced creation of the Community patent. 4. A direct effect of these changes has been rapid growth in patenting activity in most countries over the past decade. This has coincided with a wave of innovation, notably in fields such as information technology and biotechnology. It is still debated to what extent recent trends in patent regimes are a determinant or an effect of this new course in innovation. It is not the purpose of this document to answer this question; rather, this document reviews the main changes to patenting regimes in the EU, Japan and US and examines the degree to which they have strengthened patent rights.	intellectual property *** intellectual property *** innovation and growth *** research and development expenditures *** economic growth *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** patent law *** basic research *** research organisations *** research exemptions *** international level *** information technology *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2003)8	CSTP MINISTERIAL PREPARATIONS: MODULE ON IMPROVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND MOBILITY OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	2003	R	At macroeconomic level, there is growing evidence that the quality of human capital makes a substantial and positive contribution to economic growth. A sound understanding of science and the ability to approach problems in an analytical and rigorous manner increasingly underpin the skills needed in a knowledge-based economy. As such, government, research institutions and enterprises are increasingly concerned about ensuring an adequate supply of men and women trained in science and technology, people trained in S&T also play an important role in translating scientific advances into innovation and meeting the demand for skilled workers in industry. In recent years, the supply of S&T graduates has increased as evidenced by the increase in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT personnel, yet changes in public and private demand, global competition for talent and reports of scientist shortages or skill mismatches raise new challenges The discussion on human ressources could focus on the following policy challenges: Securing the long-term supply of S&T graduates, Adapting research training to new demand, Removing barriers to demand and enhancing mobility of HRST, Reaping the benefits of globalisation for developing the S&T workforce, Strengthening the statistical basis for HRST policy analysis and decision making. Research and higher education policies can encourage the development of human resources in science and technology by Improving public understanding of science and teaching, Reducing the gender gap in science education, Enhancing incentives for PhD study and post-doctorate training.  S&T policies can help improve research training by Adapting higher education,  Expanding interdisciplinary training, Capitalising on public/private partnerships to enhance research training. Public and business policies can remove barriers to demand and enhance mobility by Making public research employment attractive and flexible, Fostering mobility of public researchers Improving the career prospects and mobility of business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT personnel, Removing barriers to research careers for women. Policies can help countries reap the benefits of globalisation for developing the S&T workforce by Facilitating the international mobility of students, Providing new funding to attract talent around centres of excellence, Adapting immigration systems Facilitating the return of expatriate talent and the circulation of knowledge	economic growth *** knowledge-based economy *** research organisations *** higher education *** human resources *** higher education *** public research *** business research and development *** international mobility *** human resources	objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)1	PROGRESS REPORT AND HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE MONIT PROJECT	2004	P	The MONIT project was endorsed by the TIP working party in December 2002. Building on the results of the TIP NIS project, its main objective is to generate knowledge on how to improve innovation policy governance and create a more coherent and comprehensive innovation policy. The focus of MONIT is to develop a body of useful knowledge on capabilities of innovation policy governance. This implies a focus on capabilities for policy making processes that lead to coherent and horizontal innovation policies with contributions from non-core innovation policy areas. Preliminary findings.  (1) Increasing mismatch between challenges to be supported by policy and the institutional setup to respond to it. There are strong institutional inertia in place that have an impact on the process of aligning institutions to current challenges. A time lag is often likely resulting in the fact that current and future innovation challenges are being met by yesterdays institutions and instruments. Organizational inflexibility makes it more normal to create new structures than to try to adapt existing organisations or structures. New governance structures are created to overcome faults in normal governance structures. Development from institutional to more network and programmatic type of initiatives makes governance structures more complicated as the new structures do play a role in weaving an increasingly complex web of new and old players in the innovation system. (2) New Public Management practices may influence the strategic capabilities of governments. Throughout the 1990s general governance practices changed in many OECD countries. New Public Management (NPM) was in various ways and degrees introduced which in short led to decentralisation and governance by objectives and incentives. This tendency includes the governance practices influencing innovation policy. A major conclusion from MONIT is that this have resulted in loss of strategic capabilities if not counterbalanced by strategically oriented institutions like chabadi chabado councils. Agencification is increasing and implies co-ordination in implementation institutions. Hence, the division of labour between upper and lower levels of government is changing, leaving the upper (ministries) with policy and the lower with co-ordinating a number of instruments often financed by separate ministries. A referee function is often lacking in decentralised systems, leading to conflicts and overlaps between institutions and instruments. A trend that seems closely linked to NPM is the increased use of external bodies and committees that do play a role in formulating and implementing policies. (3) Emergent policy making outperforms deliberate policy making. The above findings also point to the potential loss of state capacity in innovation policy governance. complex, comprehensive policy areas like Information Society and Sustainable Development require great capacities from governments for these areas to be coherent. Complexity has two sources: structural and cross-sectoral that requires broader policy attention. Such policy areas are typically cutting across sectors and ministries competences, and represent  a degree of comprehensiveness that exceeds the knowledge available for traditional governance practices. Emergent policy making is different from deliberate (traditional, bureaucratic) and is less down- stream oriented, relies less on hierarchical control and information systems. It relies more on flexible, decentralised management practices, appropriate learning and flexibility. To achieve coherence, formal co-ordination may not be needed. In fact, co-ordination is itself a costly process, and comprehensive policy areas may be better off with indirect co-ordination that supports self organisation, development and use of policy relevant knowledge. Often, coherence is not achieved by consensual rational policy planning, but stems from actions of a change agent, capable to act as points of orientation or gravitation centres for other players. A change agent can however also use his position to implement formal coordination mechanisms that would not have come about without him. Emergent policy making for comprehensive, cross-cutting policy areas require well-developed information and learning systems. (4) Linking innovation policy with other policies. Comprehensive policy areas that cut across ministerial boundaries should be designed carefully  to increase the likelihood of being adopted by other ministries. (5) Policy co-ordination is a trade-off activity. Designing co-ordination mechanisms takes time and financial support. Co-ordination across policy domains: People are more decisive than structures but structures support people. Different mechanisms are typically needed at different levels.	governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** horizontal innovation policies *** policy areas *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** innovation systems *** new public management *** governance arrangements *** new public management *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** sustainable development *** policy areas *** policy areas *** governance arrangements *** policy areas *** policy areas *** policy areas *** policy domain	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)10	INNOVATION GOVERNANCE IN DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS: DRAFT SYNTHESIS REPORT OF THE MONIT PROJECT	2004	R	126. The results reported illustrate a number of dilemmas and implications for innovation policy governance in OECD countries. Developments like globalisation, a more innovation-driven economy, structural changes, ageing of populations, tight fiscal constraints etc., drive governments to long term changes in their innovation systems and socio-institutional changes in governance and policy-making. 127. Governments experience several dilemmas in this process, for example:  Significant tensions between disparate cultures, priorities and constituencies signify that traditional governance structures are under pressure. Governments must manage these tensions with the aim to create a legitimate basis for coherent agenda setting.  History counts and represents strong inertia in governance. Governments need to renew governance and institutions, and these adjustments are difficult to induce as corporatist and other influences take part in prioritization.  Many countries experience a great need to develop long term strategies for growth and change, but may lack institutional resources and mechanisms to do so. Perceived challenges are all too often not met as inherent short-termism take hold. 128. The material presented in this report point to a number of issues that need to be addressed in a 3rd generation innovation policy. They hint at some important capabilities for governments: 129. Balancing imperatives: Although innovation policy in general can rest on supportive imperatives among most policy areas, not all have the same growth imperative as innovation policy. For example, social and environmental policy, or in general policy for sustainable development, have different or even opposing objectives and imperatives. The increasing debate on climate change and carrying capacity makes in necessary for government to promote a growth model where economic growth is decoupled from environmental and social pressure. 130. Creating visions that communicate: Political leadership has a strong integrative potential. Visions play an important role in this, as they communicate rationales, objectives and preferences, and as such create a legitimate basis for priorities that may be difficult to argue for or even justify. Effective visions will also help co-ordination between ministries and agencies as a joint understanding of common efforts is more easily supported. 131. Developing appropriate knowledge bases: The innovation systems approach argue strongly for networking and collaboration between agents in the system. This is no less relevant in the case of the 3rd generation innovation with its focus on broader, comprehensive agendas. To overcome inherent inertia, governments should pay attention to the appropriateness of the knowledge base and to what degree this base is segmented and slows down integrated approaches to system and industrial development.   132. Developing a strategic, horizontal approach: While many countries lack a strategic focus, others have established institutions like chabadi chabado councils. The implication from the MONIT material indicates that even these may be too narrow as they often concentrate on core STI policies. A strategic, horizontal approach needs to include and develop the innovation policy potential in other ministerial domains and ensure a co-ordinated division of labour between them. 133. Integrating learning in governance practices: Governments need to organise strong knowledge support to achieve horizontal as well as vertical coherence. Whereas this points to managing an appropriate knowledge base and include it for policy purposes, the MONIT material also implies that governance and co-ordination modes as such may be better aligned with learning needs. In particular, governments should develop approaches to introduce what in this report is termed inherent policy making that combines learning with decentralisation and increased self-organisation. 134. Develop and implement action plans with monitoring and reporting systems: A 3rd generation innovation policy cannot be properly implemented without precise targets and intelligent follow-ups. Governments should increase their capacity to develop actions plans deducted from horizontal, strategic approaches and translate these into concrete measures to be taken by each ministry or agency. Thence, vertical coherence will be enhanced, and additionally supported by empirical facts through monitoring and indicator systems in combination with sound reporting to the strategic apex. 135. Designing agencies: As most governments have introduced New Public Management practices, the design of agencies and their interface with their principals (ministries) become crucial. Governments should design these agencies with the aim to create an effective division of labour between the two layers. While governments should retain long term policy competence, they should give agencies sufficient degree of flexibility to warrant coherent and timely implementation of policies and programmes. In particular, micro-management of these agencies is counterproductive if the goal is to achieve coherent governance. 136. Improving evaluation and learning: The evaluation practices in MONIT countries are mostly piecemeal and far less geared towards informing policy than the apparent potential. In general, governments should create a solid basis for evaluation and learning and integrate these into the policy making process. This includes also evaluation of broader reforms where knowledge about innovation impacts is useful for feedback and policy formulation. A more holistic approach to evaluation and learning will enhance the reflexive capabilities in the governance system and lead to more effective policy. 137. Developing pragmatic state-private sector interfaces: Over the years, the interface between the state and the private sector has shifted between strong intervention by the state up until the early 1980s till far less under the current dominance of New Public Management. While sound macro-economic policies and framework conditions are a must in modern innovation policy, there is a great potential for more pragmatic interfaces. These could include balanced stakeholder mechanisms as well as cluster policies where the potential for packaging a number of policy areas for a given cluster is greater. Effective interfaces are not least necessary when there is a need to leverage longer term priorities and manage transitions in structures and infrastructures.	governance arrangements *** innovation systems *** governance arrangements *** policy areas *** environmental policy *** sustainable development *** economic growth *** knowledge base *** innovation systems *** knowledge base *** governance arrangements *** knowledge base *** new public management *** policy implementation *** policy formulation *** private sector *** new public management *** framework conditions *** policy areas	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)10/ANN1	Summary Report of the MONIT Case Study on Sustainable Development	2004	P	The summary focuses on the main questions posed by the MONIT project and concentrates on  the implications and recommendations for the co-operation between environmental and innovation policy emerging from the results. The policy cycle provides a dynamic framework for monitoring the policy processes. The process can be described to consist of eight parts that further can be divided roughly into five main parts: (1) Agenda setting covers the processes needed to define the policy objectives. This includes both the national strategy setting and sectoral strategies. This part of the policy cycle is strongly influenced by different interest groups and is based on results from policy needs analysis. It also includes the processes of understandng why certain issues are on the political agenda and how they got there. This part also includes such processes and decisions made with the aim to set up the national organisational structures. (2) Design covers the part of the policy cycle where the issues that have got onto the policy agenda are formulated into concrete initiatives, programmes or policies. This involves an assessment of the situation and of the needs and the development of concrete actions. (3 Implementation part of the policy cycle refers to the implementation of the policy measures developed in the last phase. It is important to see this phase as a separate phase as the implementation is often a very different experience to that of the design of the initiatives, due to changes in context and practical trade-offs. (4) Evaluation is an important part of the policy cycle. Here the policies that were formulated and implemented are evaluated. This often takes place in the form of ex-post evaluations but increasingly in the form of ex-ante. (5) Policy learning covers all the research, analysis and interaction processes that together enable a strategic understanding of the development requirements of the policy system. Policy learning   is defined as all those processes by which policy systems generate and incorporate knowledge and understanding about a) the underlying causes and preconditions for policies and initiatives and b) the effects of the policy and initiatives. Some highlights: From a point of view of governance, it should be noted that certain cultural and institutional differences between the innovation and the sustainable development policy domain act as potential barriers to co-operation: Stakeholders differ; Policy formulation drivers differ; Policy measures differ; Resources for actions differ. Particularly in the area of chabadi chabado, there is a lack of incentives to set strong priorities for promoting sustainable development. The lack of strong incentives for promoting eco-efficiency and SD within the Science and Technology area is linked to the observed tension in the processes of prioritising between economic growth and other objectives. Across the case study countries, a common observation is that innovation policy measures are designed and implemented mostly in isolation from policy measures on environmental and sustainable development policies. The mechanisms for co-designed policy measures across the domains are, on average, weak. it was found that the biggest gap in the horizontal activities across the policy domains is in the area of policy learning, covering the accumulation of strategic intelligence and broad evaluation attitudes.	policy processes *** policy cycle *** policy cycle *** policy cycle *** policy cycle *** policy measures *** policy cycle *** sustainable development *** policy domain *** policy formulation *** policy development *** policy measures *** sustainable development *** economic growth *** sustainable development *** policy development *** policy measures *** policy measures *** policy areas *** policy domain *** sustainable development	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)14/REV1	PROPOSAL FOR PEER REVIEWS OF POLICY MIXES FOR INNOVATION	2004	S	At its June 2004 meeting, the TIP working party agreed to consider a proposal for conducting a set of peer reviews of the policy mixes used to support innovation in OECD countries. Since that time, another set of peer reviews of policy mixes for innovation has been launched by countries participating in the Open Method of Coordination groups working in support of the European Commissions Lisbon and Barcelona objectives. Opportunities exist for aligning TIP work with this OMC work in order to benefit from economies of scale and scope. PART A- Policy mixes: Background and issues. the term policy mix refers to the combination and balance of policy instruments that are used in complementary and mutually reinforcing ways to achieve the desired objectives. interest is now growing in understanding the effectiveness of the larger portfolio of policies used to improve a countrys innovative capabilities. What is the appropriate balance between policies to strengthen the  science system and those to support business Research and Development? How can efforts to develop human resources for science and technology complement programmes to boost scientific capacity? How can governments design individual instruments (e.g., tax incentives, direct financing of business Research and Development) so that they reinforce rather than interfere with each other? Is a reduce set of policy instruments more effective than a larger one, and what are the limits on streamlining? all countries have an innovation policy mix, whether it is designed from the top down (e.g., as the result of coordinated processes that create holistic innovation policies) or emerges from a more piece-meal or bottom-up approach to address individual policy challenges. PART B Peer reviews of policy mixes for innovation. Peer reviews can be an effective means for allowing participating countries to gain feedback from other countries about their policies mix, encourage cross-country comparisons of policy development and to enhance mutual learning. the main purpose is to enable countries to develop a better understanding of the issues to be considered in developing, evaluating or modifying their own policy mixes and to provide some examples of mixes used in different countries to achieve their specific purposes. PART C Scope and issues. The concept of a policy mix for innovation can be applied at several of different levels of analysis, each of which raises interesting sets of issues for examination in a peer review. One approach would be to organise each country review in a tiered fashion that investigate issues at the high, medium and more detailed levels of analysis. At a high level, a policy mix review can examine the overall balance of objectives for innovation policy, such as strengthening the science system, supporting business innovation, linking science to innovation, developing human resources or establishing framework conditions that are conducive to innovation. It might also include policies to foster the adoption of technology from abroad and/or the diffusion of innovation. It can examine whether the balance among policy objectives is well-suited to the needs of the innovation system based on its structure and  perceived level of performance. At an intermediate level, policy mixes can refer to the different routes by which the higher-level objectives are achieved. For example, it can examine the range of approaches used to support business innovation, such as increasing business Research and Development expenditure in existing firms, attracting foreign Research and Development investment, encouraging innovation in chabadu chabados or stimulating new Research and Development performers via entrepreneurship. In the area of human resources, it could consider opportunities for expanding domestic supplies, as well as for international recruitment. As such, the review can examine whether policies are well-matched to objectives and cover the range of needs. At a more detailed level, it may refer to the combination of individual policies, programmes and instruments used to achieve these objectives; for example, the combination direct funding mechanisms, fiscal incentives and grants & loans used to finance business Research and Development or the combination of competitively awarded project funding versus institutional funding for financing public research organisations. Ideally, the peer reviews would capture the full spectrum of policy instruments used to stimulate innovation, including measures to stimulate the science base, support industrial innovation (in manufacturing and services, as well as in large firms and chabadu chabados) strengthen industry-science linkages and promote technology adoption and diffusion. Elements of framework conditions (e.g., intellectual property regimes) could also be included. In practice, this scope may be too wide to enable serious consideration of interactions among individual instruments. Furthermore, many of the policy instruments that affect innovation performance are developed, managed and implemented by different government ministries, making coordination of peer reviews more difficult.	policy mix *** peer review *** support innovation *** policy mix *** peer review *** policy mix *** policy mix *** policy instruments *** business research and development *** science system *** human resources *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** policy instruments *** policy mix *** policy mix *** peer review *** policy mix *** peer review *** policy development *** policy mix *** policy mix *** peer review *** human resources *** framework conditions *** policy mix *** business innovation *** science system *** diffusion of innovation *** innovation systems *** policy mix *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** small and medium sized firms *** business innovation *** research and development expenditures *** human resources *** business research and development *** research organisations *** small and medium sized firms *** science base *** industrial innovation *** peer review *** policy instruments *** industry-science relationships *** intellectual property *** framework conditions *** innovation performance *** peer review *** policy instruments *** policy mix *** peer review	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)15	GLOBALISATION AND chabadi chabado BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THE BELGIAN CONFERENCE	2004	R	26. The trend towards the internationalisation of Science and Technology raises a number of key issues, which concern policy makers, both from a host and a home country perspective.  Are outward Research and Development investments complementary with domestic Research and Development activities or do they substitute one for the other?  What is the impact of cross-border (both national and regional) knowledge spillovers and Research and Development collaborations on the national and regional innovation systems?  Whereas there is no doubt that Science and Technology output (e.g. scientific publications and patents) is and will remain a major contributor to economic growth at a global scale, it still needs to be investigated how globalisation of firms Research and Development strategies changes the conditions for such a link to hold at a national or regional level. 27. In order to compensate for the internationalisation of Research and Development investment by its domestic firms, institutions and Research and Development workers moving abroad, a country should be able to simultaneously attract innovative companies, Research and Development institutes and Research and Development workers from abroad, thus avoiding hollowing out. Not only excellence in research but also market opportunities are important for the international attractiveness of locations. 28. With the growth of new world centers of excellence, the economic welfare of a country or region depends increasingly on its ability to assimilate and acquire knowledge developed elsewhere. In this respect, the absorptive capacities of large as well as small enterprises, and also Research and Development institutions need to be strengthened. In addition, international mobility needs to be fostered. Local firms, institutions and researchers need to be encouraged to access international networks. 29. Which instruments should chabadi chabado makers use? Which instruments are currently being used by chabadi chabado makers? Can we find best practices? This section will present an overview of the literature on this as well as an overview of OECD-countries practices.	home country *** research and development expenditures *** research and development activities *** innovation systems *** scientific publications *** development strategies *** regional level *** economic growth *** research and development expenditures *** internationalisation of research *** international mobility *** best practices	internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)16	INTERNATIONALISATION OF Research and Development  POLICY QUESTIONNAIRE	2004	P	The following questionnaire focuses on major policy areas in which governments can develop measures deemed to have an impact on the benefits that can be derived from the process and  anticipated patterns of internationalisation of Research and Development or limit their possible adverse effects. For each policy area, respondents are invited to indicate if the measure(s) mentioned in the questionnaire (or similar ones) exist in their country and, when applicable, to briefly describe each of these measures in a few sentences. Respondents are encouraged to highlight and describe in more detail those measures that they consider to be particularly important, or to represent good practices that could be emulated at the international level. Key questions are: Does your country have an explicit strategy to adapt to and benefit from the internationalisation of Research and Development? Are there any specific measures that support the location of new Research and Development activities in your country through foreign direct investment? Are there any specific measures at the national level to link domestic firms, in particular chabadu chabados, to foreign sources of research and innovation, including international co-operation in Research and Development? What are the principles concerning the treatment of foreign firms (both non-domiciled firms and foreign-owned subsidiaries) or foreign research institutions in your countrys Research and Development related policies? Are there any specific measures that support the internationalisation of domestic Public Research Institutions? Are there any obstacles to subsidiaries of foreign Public Research Institutions setting up and operating in your country? Describe the most important developments in immigration policy with respect to the requirements of Science and Technology in the past decade. Are there any specific measures in your country to encourage the return of expatriated scientists and engineers who work abroad?	policy areas *** internationalisation of research *** policy areas *** good practices *** international level *** internationalisation of research *** research and development activities *** foreign direct investment *** international co-operation *** small and medium sized firms *** foreign firms *** research organisations *** research organisations *** research organisations *** internationalisation of research	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)18	TIP CASE STUDIES ON INNOVATION: ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY: PROGRESS REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION AND FINALISATION	2004	P	The Case Studies in Innovation are aimed at identifying the specificities of the processes of knowledge creation, diffusion and exploitation in selected fields of technology or industry sectors while adopting the overall framework of National Innovation Systems. This document aims to inform the TIP of the progress of work as well as of the time schedule for work in completion concerning the two case studies on Energy technology and Pharmaceutical biotechnology.. Energy technology. Countries participating in the case study on Energy technology have been concentrating their efforts on fuel cell technology, although some countries are examining other technologies as well (oil and gas, renewable energy, advanced turbines). At present drafts of all the country reports (12 in total) have been completed, as has a  bibliometric analysis conducted by the Secretariat. A draft Case Study Synthesis was presented at the Meeting of the TIP Working Party. Pharmaceutical biotechnology: Seven Country Reports  as well as a complementary study on Marine biotechnology conducted by Norway  are available. A draft Case Study Synthesis Report (excluding some chapters) was presented at the Meeting of the TIP Working Party. The overall Synthesis Report of the project will be prepared by the Secretariat with the support of the lead countries of the Focus Groups. Specifically, this report will draw conclusions concerning the balance between horizontal innovation policies and more customised policy measures that take  into account sector-specific characteristics of National Innovation Systems	business sector *** national innovation systems *** energy technology *** energy technology *** fuel cells *** horizontal innovation policies *** national innovation systems *** policy measures *** energy technology	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)2	INNOVATION POLICY AND PERFORMANCE: INTRODUCTION AND SYNTHESIS	2004	R	82. The synthesized country studies provide a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of participating countries National Innovation Systems and innovation policies, and succeed in identifying broad relationships between countries innovation performance and policies. Combining quantitative information with informed judgment and interpretation contributed significantly to this. The country studies provide evidence that the specific economic and institutional conditions need to be taken into account in order to be able to assess countries innovation policy and make their experience applicable to others. Even amongst the OECD member countries participating in this study  which are relatively homogenous in terms of income per capita  NIS vary greatly in their structural features and modes of governance. Accordingly there is no single optimal policy in terms of the design of either individual instruments or the mix of policies readily transferable to different contexts. Nevertheless there is common ground. A common feature of all countries is that at some point of time national economic circumstances combined with global changes in science, technology and innovation have induced or are currently inducing fundamental changes in related policies. The country studies addressed a number of policy issues. While some of these policy themes are more prominent in one country than in others, others are shared by countries with similar features. Certain key policy issues emerged in most or all of them, primarily related to the current transition to a knowledge-based economy. The following specific policy issues emerging from the country notes have been discussed in detail: industry-science relations, Public Private Partnerships, high-technology chabadu chabados, barriers to growth in chabadu chabados and problems of existing middle market firms, rationalisation and governance of innovation policy, globalisation of Research and Development and, tentatively, innovation in services. Experiences both in terms of success and failure, discussed in their proper context, provide valuable information for policy learning, in particular about how countries manage to adapt their policies in a dynamic environment.	countrys innovation performance *** national innovation systems *** policy mix *** knowledge-based economy *** public private partnerships *** innovation in services *** small and medium sized firms *** globalisation of research *** governance arrangements	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_services *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)3	PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION	2004	R	1. Peer reviews of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for innovation (Public Private Partnerships)1 have been undertaken as part of the DSTI-wide project on Micro-Policies for Productivity and Growth which aims to further explore the main micro-drivers of growth. This project involves the main STI Committees  CSTP, ICCP and CIBE  and comprises four modules: fostering innovation and technology diffusion, seizing the benefits of ICT, fostering firm creation and entrepreneurship, and enhancing human capital and realising its potential. For each of these modules, the project involves the selection of a specific policy domain for in-depth examination through a peer review of relevant policies in a limited number of countries, with a view to deriving lessons that can be useful to all countries considering policy reform in this area. 2. Public Private Partnerships for innovation is the specific policy domain that has been selected under the general theme fostering innovation and technology diffusion. The role of Public Private Partnerships in the innovation policy of Austria, Australia, France and the Netherlands, with a focus on flagship Public Private Parnership programmes,2 has been accordingly examined at two TIP peer review meetings (June and December 2003). Country reports were subsequently prepared and published. The peer review process will be completed by the end of this year with the review of Spain. Introduction 3. A major conclusion of the OECD Growth Study was that governments need to be more responsive to the rapid transformation of innovation processes and related business needs and strategies, and that greater use of Public Private Partnerships can increase this responsiveness and therefore enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of technology and innovation policy. 4. Public Private Partnerships for research sets a framework for the public and the private sectors to join forces in areas where they have complementary interests but cannot act as efficiently alone. Traditional in building physical infrastructures, they are increasingly popular in research and development policy because they are unique tools to fill certain gaps in innovation systems (e.g. the lack of interaction between industry and public research), increase the efficiency of government policy in addressing some market failures that affect innovation processes (e.g. high cost and risk of pre-competitive research), and address new societal needs, especially when this requires long-term multidisciplinary research. But deriving such potential benefits challenge the capability of governments of using Public Private Partnerships for the right purposes and managing them efficiently. This paper draws the main lessons from the completed peer-reviews of four countries regarding such optimal implementation of Public Private Parnership programmes.	public private partnerships *** peer review *** fostering innovation *** technology diffusion *** policy domain *** peer review *** public private partnerships *** fostering innovation *** policy domain *** technology diffusion *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** peer review *** peer review *** public private partnerships *** innovation process *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** innovation systems *** public research *** innovation process *** market failures *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships

DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)4/FINAL	PROMOTING INNOVATION IN SERVICES	2004	R	This document presents work on innovation in services that is conducted as part of the OECDs horizontal project Enhancing the Performance of the Service Sector. It draws on existing STI statistics, recent innovation surveys, and a policy questionnaire circulated to TIP and CSTP delegates to characterise innovation in service sector industries and identify policy measures being implemented in OECD countries to improve innovation in services. It is a revised and extended version of Chapter 4 of the OECDs Science, Technology and Industry Outlook 2004, entitled Promoting Innovation in Services, that includes a more detailed examination of the role of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT protection in the service sector. As indicated, the service sector is of growing importance in OECD economies. Productivity and employment growth are highly dependent on the success of service industries, and services are strong drivers of recent economic growth in most OECD economies. Statistical evidence supports the notion that services are increasingly knowledge-based, innovative and drivers of growth. Service-sector firms in general are less likely to innovate than manufacturing firms, but they are becoming more innovative and knowledge-intensive, and services such as financial intermediation and business services show above- average levels of innovation. Enhancing innovation in the service sector requires attention to a number of policy areas, with different emphases than for manufacturing as listed below.  Service-sector innovation derives less from investments in formal Research and Development and draws more extensively on acquisition of knowledge from outside sources that is acquired through purchases of equipment and intellectual property, as well as via collaboration.  Human resource development is especially important to service firms, given their high reliance on highly skilled and highly educated workers, as well as indications that a lack of highly skilled personnel is a major impediment to service innovation in most OECD economies.  The role of newly established firms in innovative activity is greater in services than in manufacturing, so that entrepreneurship is also a key driver of service innovation. Nonetheless, small firms tend to be less innovative than larger firms.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT protection has also drawn considerable attention, especially as relates to software and business method patents, which seem to have strong links to innovation in services. While the effect of different policy regimes on service sector innovation is uncertain, it is clear that changes in policy regimes governing software-related patents and business method patents would have an effect on the service-sector firms, regardless of their main activities. To date, however, innovation policy measures in most OECD countries have not been attuned to the service sector. Only a few countries have integrated services-related concerns into their innovation policies, and participation of service-sector firms in sector-neutral programmes remains low. The few policies targeting service innovation aim primarily at ICT development and use. Clearly, greater effort is needed to raise awareness of innovation policies and programmes among service-sector firms, as well as to design or adapt support programmes to be more relevant and useful to the service sector.	services sector *** innovation in services *** business sector *** services sector *** innovation in services *** policy measures *** intellectual property *** services sector *** innovation in services *** services sector *** service industries *** employment growth *** economic growth *** service industries *** services sector *** policy areas *** intellectual property *** human resources *** innovation in services *** innovation activities *** innovation in services *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** innovation in services *** services sector *** services sector *** policy measures *** innovation in services *** support programmes *** services sector *** innovation in services	policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_services *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)5	RENEWAL OF THE MANDATE OF THE TIP WORKING PARTY	2004	M	Taking into account the priorities established by the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP), the Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy will advise upon innovation and technology policies that enhance productivity, facilitate the creation, diffusion and application of knowledge, and foster sustainable growth and the creation of highly skilled employment. In particular, the Working Party will: (a) Promote the exchange of information on new developments in the design, implementation and evaluation of innovation and technology policies, the management of science-innovation interfaces and the functioning of formal and informal markets for knowledge exchange, (b) Review specific policies and the mixes of policies put in place to foster the efficient and complementary use of public and private resources devoted to innovation, notably through the strengthening of industry-science linkages, and identify good practices in this area. (c) Assess the implications of the increased globalisation of economic activities, in particular those related to Research and Development, on innovation performance and policy, notably as regards the development of intellectual assets. (d) Consider ways of encouraging international co-operation in the analysis, formulation and implementation of innovation policy, including between member and non-member countries. In developing its activities the Working Party will: (a) Draw upon and extend the National Innovation Systems framework it has contributed to develop. (b) Ensure an adequate balance between sectoral and economy-wide approaches to innovation  and consider the regional (infra or supra national) aspects of innovation policy. (c) Make use of a range of methodologies, including surveys, workshops, peer reviews and quantitative analysis, in its policy assessment work. (d) Contribute to the reviews of science, technology and innovation policy that may be entrusted to the Secretariat by member countries or Observers to the CSTP.  Identify new requirements for policy-relevant indicators. The Working Party will undertake its work in close co-operation with other relevant bodies of the Organisation and other international organisations in order to increase the benefits of their respective activities and to avoid duplication of effort.	good practices *** industry-science relationships *** implementation and evaluation *** policy mix *** innovation performance *** intellectual assets *** policy implementation *** international co-operation *** national innovation systems *** peer review	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)8	KNOWLEDGE INTENSIVE SERVICES IN INNOVATION: THE CHANGING ROLE OF KISA IN THE INNOVATION SYSTEM INTERIM REPORT	2004	P	Knowledge intensive services comprise more than just KIBS, private firms providing market- based services to other firms. Services supporting innovation are also provided by public and private research institutions, other public services and through network connections on a non-market basis. In addition, firms themselves provide internally an important share of crucial services. The definition of  KISA adopted in this study covers all these. KISA is not a sector or cluster, but a function present in all industries. A variety of theoretical perspectives and concepts are applied to interpret the empiric results. For example, why firms use certain types of KISAs is related to the business model chosen by the firm. The way, how a firm uses KISAs has its roots in the structure and nature of the value network in which the firm is engaged. In addition, the need for KISAs changes along with the life span of the innovation and the product. If services related to research development are important in the early stages, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, commercialization, marketing and production process development related KISAs may be much more important during other stages of the innovation life cycle. Thus a firm struggling with the development of a new innovation has a distinctively different profile of KISA usage than a firm trying to break into the international market with a more established innovation. Different types of industries are included in the study: software represents an innovative cluster with services in the core; health care is an example of a sector with a complex set up of actors and  intensive public - private partnerships. The other cases were chosen by the participating countries to highlight their production structures. They may (e.g. forest industry) represent mature industries with traditional  manufacturing in  the core.  But also  more directly consumer-oriented  service industries  were included (tourism, leisure). (1) Software. The main sources of KISAs in the sector are: External consultancies and research and technology organisations (RTO)s, Internal KISA experts working within the firm and KISAs based on network linkages. External knowledge-intensive business service providers are mostly used in a supportive function for business management and development, e.g. in training and auditing. The results indicate that KIBS providers and RTOs are needed and used, especially, when expanding into international markets. In the context of software, KISA is a complicated concept. The sector itself is a most important producer of knowledge intensive services, and it is often difficult to differentiate the roles of a user and a producer, when studying the activities within and between software firms. (2) Healthcare.  The healthcare domain tends to focus on professions. Management and leadership tend to have less importance. Thus complicated and rigid tensions between various professional groups and others participating in the system tend to rise. This state of affairs seems to be shifting slowly towards management and leadership. However, the trend is slow although it is picking up speed. In all, it is not easy to analyse the health care sector in terms of KISA. As such, the content of the final product offered by the sector is at least as much a knowledge intensive service as it is in the case if the software sector. (3) Traditional maturing industries. Industries chosen include mining and forest industry. The number of KISAs is growing in the forest industry and their role in the industrys renewal process is becoming more and more important. Paper industry is increasingly outsourcing its services to suppliers, including basic software coding, energy supply (power plants), service and maintenance functions etc. Albeit extensive outsourcing, paper industry is keen to keep the core knowledge tightly in its own hands. The development of process control and systems monitoring are good examples of this. The firms knowledge on the techno-economic process as a whole comprises a number of knowledge intensive services that together enable the overall control and development of the business entity. It is, naturally, a key asset the firm wants to keep in its own hand.  (4) Policy implications and expectations: It is not really possible to define KISA related policies from the outset. KISA role varies by industry, and even by network. The research results indicate a certain duality of policy measures related to KISA: On the one hand, broad-spectrum policy measures to enhance innovation in services generally exist in all countries. On the other hand, target specific measures tailored for supporting either the production or use of particular services have been introduced in some countries. For example, Australia has a measure, Commercialising Emerging Technologies, to enhance firm access to and use of external KISA for new spin-off and start-up firms. While the role  and nature of  KISA varies largely by industry, so do policy measures. Policies supporting KISA in Health Care innovation are usually quite different from the ones supporting software KISA. Generally, KISA policy implications are mostly indirect and different by industry. They can be formulated only after studying the KISA role and the existing policy portfolio by industry and country on a concrete level	knowledge intensive services *** private firms *** research organisations *** business research and development *** support innovation *** business models *** intellectual property *** life cycle *** health care *** service industries *** knowledge intensive services *** software industry *** health care *** knowledge intensive services *** knowledge intensive services *** research results *** innovation in services *** policy measures *** policy measures *** health care *** knowledge intensive services *** innovation systems	firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_services *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2004)9	RESULTS OF OECD MINI-SURVEY ON NANOTECHNOLOGY Research and Development PROGRAMMES	2004	R	At its meeting in March 2003, the CSTP expressed growing interest in issues related to nanotechnology, including the status of ongoing RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and innovation activities in OECD countries. As a result, the OECD Secretariat is collecting information on the publicly funded nanotechnology RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and innovation programmes/initiatives in OECD member countries. a short questionnaire requests information related to: 1) definitions of nanotechnology used in policy making and statistical activities; 2) organisation of government nanotechnology efforts (does a single agency co-ordinate nanotechnology RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT policy? Do multiple ministries/agencies manage and conduct nanotechnology RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT in their own domains? Do research councils allocate funding or is it allocated directly by government ministries?) ; 3) national nanotechnology RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT programmes (Distinguish between those programmes that aim specifically at nanotechnology and those with other primary objectives (e.g. broad-based business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT support programmes), but in which some nanotechnology RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT is conducted. ; 4) other innovation-related initiatives/programmes targeted at nanotechnology (list and describe other initiatives aimed at stimulating innovation in nanotechnology, such as those designed to promote commercialisation (e.g.promotion of public/private partnerships, technology transfer mechanisms, demonstration programmes, venture capital funding), training of human resources (e.g. launch of specific educational programmes dedicated to nanotechnology), or the provision of research infrastructure (e.g. creation of interdisciplinary research centres or research networks, access to databases).  5) available statistics on nanotechnology RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. As this overview illustrates, OECD countries are taking a number of steps to strengthen their capabilities in nanoscience and technology. Funding is being increased in many countries, national initiatives are being elaborated and new structures are being put in place to coordinate them. Statistics continue to lag, in particular as regards industrial efforts in nanotechnology. The rapid pace of change may make any process of documenting nanotechnology initiatives difficult, as information becomes rapidly out- dated. Nevertheless, there may be value in providing an framework for international comparisons and to enhance cross-country learning. Delegates are invited to discuss how work on nanotechnology should continue at this point in time within the TIP working party.	innovation activities *** development programmes *** business research and development *** support programmes *** supporting research and development *** stimulating innovation *** venture capital *** human resources *** technology transfer *** development programmes	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)1/REV1	INNOVATION IN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY: SYNTHESIS REPORT	2005	R	84. As this report illustrates, energy technology offers an interesting perspective from which to examine sectoral innovation systems and the role of government policy. The energy sector consists of a diverse set of sub-sectors ranging from electricity generation to automotive propulsion, and of technologies, from mature technologies, such as oil and gas, to emergent technologies, such as fuel cells. Innovation processes in each case are different, entailing different sets of actors and different technological trajectories, and different sets of complementary assets needed to bring new technologies to the market place. 85. In addition, energy is a domain in which governments have traditionally played a significant role. Despite widespread privatisation of energy production and distribution systems, most OECD governments maintain a strong role in the energy sector, developing national energy policies to ensure adequate supplies of energy and often conducting Research and Development themselves, increasingly in collaboration with private sector organisations. Governments already have a range of policies in place that are specifically tailored to the needs of the energy sector and for encouraging research, development, demonstration and deployment. While so-called horizontal sector-neutral policies are important for stimulating innovation in energy technology, sector-specific policy development has long been the norm. For example, while fuel cell related research is often funded under broad-based government programmes (e.g., generic research programmes funded by ministries of science or industry), many governments have established specific funding programmes for energy researchand specifically for fuel cell Research and Development that are financed by energy ministries. While sector-neutral efforts to enhance industry-science linkages can facilitate collaboration  and technology transfer related to energy and fuel cell technologies, many governments have put in place specific public/private partnership programmes to ensure that government laboratories active in the energy sector are well-linked to private-sector efforts. 86. As this study illustrates, the specific roles of governments may vary from one energy domain to another, as may the relative size of its contribution. In more mature fields, government may play less of a role in innovation, which tends to move in a more incremental fashion. But it can help encourage more significant innovation in these fields by assuming some of the risk and helping establish new objectives, as in the case of the ATS. In emerging technological areas, such as fuel cells, the role of government appears much greater. Such technologies not only require considerable amounts of researchoften basic research that is not adequately funded by the private sectorbut also the development of complementary assets to allow their integration into established or newly emerging power distribution systems. 87. Because hydrogen fuel cells are a new technology that could transform the entire energy economy with potentially large private and social benefits, governments, public research organizations, industry, universities and chabadu chabados all play major roles in technology innovation. In particular, government funding, policy incentives, and market conditioning could have significant impacts on the commercialization of the technology. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS are used widely by the countries for generating, acquiring, diffusing and using knowledge in the fuel cell innovation process. Moreover, the partnerships help governments identify Research and Development gaps and opportunities, and industry to share risks of investing in pre-commercial technology. 88. In contrast, technology innovation in the mature and deeply entrenched industries such as oil and gas has evolved over a long period of time, and it is currently carried out largely by the powerful oil industry with more limited roles played by the governments. With the diminishing government Research and Development funding in recent decades, the roles of PROs and universities in oil and gas technology innovation have declined as well. The main driver of technology innovation is economics, i.e., improving the efficiency of   existing technologies to boost production without causing environmental damage. As a result, most innovation activities are concentrated more on applied Research and Development than basic research. Unlike in hydrogen fuel cells, for mature industries such as oil and gas, patents and scientific publications are not important factors in innovation process. Rather than developing proprietary knowledge, oil and gas companies typically acquire know-how through innovative technology applications. 89. In both areas of energy technology, policy also needs to adapt to increasing globalisation. As noted in this report, innovation in fuel cell technology is already highly internationalised, and both public and private sector organisations have taken steps to enhance international linkages and coordination. In the oil and gas sector, most Research and Development activities are carried out by domestic research centers, but the growing trend is to outsource Research and Development to domestic and foreign oilfield service companies. Internationalization of innovation in oil and gas technologies, however, is not as extensive as in fuel cell innovation. While there are benefits to leveraging Research and Development resources by networking and forming alliances with firms and research organizations in foreign countries, it could have implications for INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, Research and Development investment and other Science and Technology policies. Governments will need to adapt policies to help improve national benefits from globalised innovation activities. More work is needed to understand how this can best be done. 90. Hydrogen fuel cells are far from being commercialized, and realized economic benefits are currently small. With the steadily advancing technology and more favourable market conditions, considerable opportunities exist to achieve the promised economic and environmental benefits of their widespread use. Large scale commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells may take decades or longer, and successful commercialization of the technology will require sustained funding from both public and private sectors. In addition to funding of Research and Development, government policies that foster PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, development of human resources, and market conditioning, including codes and standards, could spur innovation and commercialization of the hydrogen fuel cell technology. Given the vast distance to mass markets in this area, government support will continue to play a vital role in fuel cell innovation.	innovation systems *** energy technology *** fuel cells *** energy sector *** innovation process *** new technologies *** private sector *** energy sector *** energy sector *** policy development *** stimulating innovation *** energy technology *** research programmes *** fuel cells *** government programmes *** fuel cells *** energy sector *** industry-science relationships *** private partnerships in sti *** technology transfer *** fuel cells *** basic research *** small and medium sized firms *** fuel cells *** public research *** new technologies *** fuel cells *** innovation process *** public private partnerships *** existing technologies *** applied research *** innovation activities *** basic research *** fuel cells *** innovation process *** scientific publications *** energy technology *** private sector *** fuel cells *** research and development activities *** fuel cells *** research and development expenditures *** intellectual property *** innovation activities *** fuel cells *** private sector *** fuel cells *** human resources *** fuel cells *** public private partnerships *** fuel cells *** energy technology	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)10	INNOVATION SURVEYS: EXTRACTING GREATER POLICY VALUE, A PROPOSAL	2005	S	The purpose of this proposal is to establish an Expert Group to develop an internationally comparable set of core innovation survey questions that could provide comparable indicators and data of high relevance for policy and for econometric analysis. Both the policy and academic communities have a strong interest in internationally comparable indicators from innovation surveys. These could be used to provide a picture of innovation efforts across countries, as done in publications such as the OECDs Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard, or the European Commissions Innovation Scoreboard. The first goal is to identify a set of core questions where international comparability would be most useful for the policy community, such as to improve our understanding of the role of national characteristics or of cross-border knowledge diffusion on innovation outcomes. it is possible to construct indicators for different types of innovation capabilities using questions on the nature of the firms innovation, e.g. whether or not the firm has introduced new-to-market or new-to-firm innovations, and whether or not the firm primarily adopts innovations developed elsewhere or if it has creative capabilities in-house. One area where this approach has been successfully used by the OECD is in research on the economic impacts of new information technologies (ICTs) at the firm level	diffusion of knowledge *** innovation capacity *** innovative firms *** economic impacts *** information technology	policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)11	PROPOSAL FOR TIP PROJECT ON INNOVATION POLICY GOVERNANCE: LEARNING FROM GOOD PRACTICE	2005	S	Policy makers are faced with the following key challenges: (1) Increased speed of change. The global, national and regional context changes faster than it is possible to realise the full impact of any single policy measure. Thus policies often have to be adjusted already before sufficient knowledge of their effects is available. (2) Increased complexity. As the complexity of the economy and society increases, so does the complexity of policy measures. As observed results are combinations of various policy measures (and lack of them), it is difficult to be specific about the impact of single policies. This means that different policies and policy measures have to be designed in co-ordination with each other, in order to form an integrated set of actions supporting a favoured development trajectory. (3) More uncertainty. All policy is originally based on some analysis of existing needs, where government intervention is seen as the most effective way to meet them. But as circumstances change continuously, the original rationale might erode already in the early phases of implementation. This means that policies and policy measures should be continuously forced to question not only if the implementation is efficient and amounting to expected results, but also whether the original rationale is still valid. (4) Expanding system boundaries. Increasing co-operation and networking, new business models, changing value chains, changing company structures, new forms of Public Private Partnerships, etc. link actors into networks that extend over all predefined boundaries. This involves an increasing set of stakeholders and framework conditions into the policy processes, which in turn implies for horizontal and multi-dimensional policies. To face these challenges, new innovative policy governance practices have to be introduced. For this, a static view over organisational structures and comparisons of policy measures in detail is not enough. A more dynamic approach is needed. A deeper understanding of good innovation policy performance implies a more thorough look into policy processes and the dynamics of innovation policy governance. Policy learning needs to be enhanced and experiences need to be shared across the nations to increase the understanding of how successful future innovation policy can be created. The ultimate aim of the proposed project is to contribute to the development of good innovation policy governance. A more immediate goal is to support policy makers in their efforts to learn from experiences and through transferring good practices. This overall aim is divided into the two objectives to provide innovation policy makers practical support for policy development: (a) To develop practical tools for policy learning to be used in assessing the success of innovation policy processes and in learning from other countries practices. Examples of such tools could be new types of policy evaluation approaches and check lists of specific factors to be taken into account in assessing the transferability of policy practices. (b) To understand why certain practices in innovation policy processes are perceived as well functioning and why some practices have not worked as well as expected. This understanding helps to assess the preconditions for transferability and increases the adapting capabilities of innovation policy governance. The proposed study thus addresses two major research needs: (a) To increase the understanding of innovation policy processes: What are the specific characteristics of innovation policy processes? To what extent are these strongly dependent on national contexts and on other framework conditions? How are policies formulated and how does the policy process react to changes and pressures caused by external influences? What is the capability of the innovation policy to adapt to the changes? What is expected to happen in the future when innovation policy in different countries takes new formats? (b) To increase the understanding of good practices in innovation policy: What can be considered as good practice in innovation policy and why? What can be considered as less successful practices and why? What have been the main features of successful practices and practice transfers? What are the preconditions for transferring practices and learning from these from one nation to other nations? How can the learning processes be enhanced?	policy measures *** policy measures *** policy measures *** policy measures *** policy measures *** new forms of innovation *** public private partnerships *** value chains *** business models *** policy processes *** framework conditions *** governance arrangements *** policy measures *** policy processes *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** good practices *** policy processes *** policy development *** policy practices *** policy evaluations *** policy processes *** governance arrangements *** policy processes *** framework conditions *** policy processes *** good practices *** governance arrangements *** good practices	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)12	VALUATION AND EXPLOITATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: SYNTHESIS REPORT	2005	R	94. The analyses presented in this paper suggest that firms extract value from their patents through a range of mechanisms, not only by using patent protection to establish a dominant position in the market place, but also by gaining additional revenues and access to complementary technology via licensing, by using the patents as bargaining chips in negotiations with other firms (e.g., regarding mergers and acquisitions, joint venture and cross-licensing) by and by attracting external sources of financing (e.g., from banks or venture capitalists). Improved exploitation demands better methods of valuing patents and greater efficiency in technology licensing markets. 95. While the main players for the development of technology markets and of valuation techniques will come from the private sector, efforts of governments are also required to some extent. Those efforts vary from country to country and organisation to organisation. There is a general consensus on the need for governments to ensure the efficient operation of patent systems, as well as to provide information on patent applications and grants, and put in place regulatory environments that encourage patent management in PROs. Most governments have also taken steps to supporting education and training programms for particular populations of patent holders (e.g., PROs, chabadu chabados), and some have begun to complement or support industry efforts to develop guidelines for IP reporting and valuation. Cooperation among stakeholders and cooperation among governments can help facilitate such efforts and develop good practice. International efforts are required in many fields including collection of data related technology markets to develop improved indicators to enable policy analysis more reliable. In this situation, international organisations are also expected to play great role to facilitate IP as an economic assets	joint ventures *** technology markets *** private sector *** small and medium sized firms *** good practices *** technology markets *** intellectual property	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)13	TAX TREATMENT OF BUSINESS INVESTMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL ASSETS: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON	2005	R	1. A competitive and stable tax policy has a potential to be an effective tool for promoting innovation and influencing a countrys friendliness to business innovation. An important way of designing an effective and innovation-friendly tax policy is to learn from mechanisms and experiences existing in other countries, particularly those that are successful in achieving high innovation outcomes. 2. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax treatment of investments in selected intellectual assets in the OECD countries and provide a way to compare tax systems for intellectual assets across countries. Five categories of corporate investments in intellectual assets are examined: research and development (Research and Development), patents, training, software and organizational change. 3. The report confirms the trend that OECD countries continue to invest in fiscal policy tools to promote Research and Development and innovation. As market based, tax incentives do not discriminate between Research and Development projects  they are broadly accessible by business and available for any Research and Development activity. This is unlike grants through which government can select specific projects, for example those from which it expects large spillover effects in the long term. In part, the increased use of fiscal instruments to stimulate investment in Research and Development and other intellectual assets reflects the desire of governments to achieve various national or supranational Research and Development targets. But it is also a reflection of the need by governments to enhance business environment in order to attract new investment, spurred by an aggressive competition for Research and Development-based investment worldwide. The following are important findings:  Many OECD countries  two thirds out of 27 examined - have already put in place an Research and Development tax incentive. This compares with only 50 per cent of OECD countries found to be using Research and Development tax incentives in 1996.  Patents in the countries examined are treated as depreciable assets not as revenue expenses that can be deducted in the year incurred. While most software, organizational change and start-up, and training and Research and Development expenditures can be immediately deducted in the year the expenditures are made (i.e. current deduction), there is no such provision available for the acquisition of patents.  Patents, unlike Research and Development, do not enjoy any specific tax incentives, other than provisions that allow for accelerated depreciation of patent costs. But tax incentives for patents are channeled indirectly through broader schemes which encourage investments in Research and Development and other intangible assets. Patents can be an input to, and output of, the Research and Development process which may help to explain the relative dearth of patent-specific tax incentives. Patents may have already benefited from the Research and Development tax incentives existing in many OECD countries. Finally, we may be overlooking other channels for the incentive tax treatment of patents, especially the growing role of patent donations.  Corporate training is the next area  after Research and Development  where tax credits exist, unlike in the area of patents, software and organizational change. While these incentives are not as widespread as Research and Development tax credits, their emergence points to the growing emphasis governments put today on human resource development and lifelong learning.    Main channels for the tax treatment of software are current expensing or accelerated depreciation. However, similar to patents, business software development expenses which constitute eligible Research and Development expenditure may earn tax incentives applicable to Research and Development expenditures in those countries that provide them. There is only one country  Japan  that provides a tax credit earmarked specifically for information and communication technology (ICT) investments, including purchased software.  There is no tax credit geared to organizational expenses. However, full deductibility of organizational expenses prevails, meaning that this type of intangible expenditure is largely treated by tax authorities as current business expense. 4. Is there any obvious relationship between tax treatments of intellectual assets at the country level? As Table 1 indicates, countries that provide Research and Development tax incentives are more likely to offer incentives for other types of intellectual assets. But this likelihood doesnt appear to be strong enough to warrant far reaching conclusions, as there is little evidence that selective tax incentives exist in such intellectual asset areas such as patents, software and organizational change. However, there are countries which national tax- based innovation policies seem to be more holistic. These are, in particular, Austria, France, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, and perhaps Korea. 5. The driving force behind this trend appears to be recognition by governments that Research and Development does not operate in vacuum and as such is not sufficient to bring new products or services to market and increase industrial productivity. Other key factors that shape business innovation but lie outside of Research and Development include investments in intellectual assets such as patents and patent rights, skilled workforce and organizational flexibility.	tax incentives *** business innovation *** tax incentives *** intellectual assets *** tax systems *** tax systems *** organisational change *** intellectual assets *** policy profiles *** tax incentives *** development activities *** intellectual assets *** research investments *** development targets *** business environment *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** research use *** organisational change *** research and development expenditures *** tax incentives *** research investments *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** organisational change *** tax incentives *** human resources *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** research and development expenditures *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** intellectual assets *** intellectual assets *** tax incentives *** organisational change *** tax incentives *** new products *** intellectual assets *** business innovation *** intellectual property *** intellectual assets *** tax systems	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_tax_incentives
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)14	RESEARCH USE OF PATENTED KNOWLEDGE - A REVIEW	2005	R	1. This Report reviews the literature on research exemptions in patent law in OECD countries. Concerns have been expressed, in a number of nations without a strong exemption, that patent law has the potential to limit scientific research. The limitation may occur where it is too difficult, or too expensive, for a researcher to obtain the permission, through a licence, for example, of a patent-holder to use a patented invention. 2. Two conclusions are drawn from a survey of the law and the economic theory. First, any exemption that is to be proposed must comply with both the requirements of current international legal obligations, in particular, the TRIPs Agreement, and the economic rationale that can be seen to justify the exemption  it should encourage investment in non-commercial research but should not adversely impact on the returns on investment of the patent holder. The second conclusion to be drawn from the survey is that there is a wide variation, amongst OECD countries, in the exemptions that allow for the use of patented inventions either generally for research purposes or specifically for the purposes of gaining regulatory approval. 3. A review of the literature suggests that there are a number of concerns with respect to the impact of patents on future scientific research. Much of the anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that researchers do not consider that patents have caused significant problems in the conduct of their research, although this may be partly because they are ignoring the law where it is unclear. Overall, there is a legitimate concern that the effects of increased patenting activity on research may increase over time. 4. The specific options for a research exemption explored (including a statutory exemption, a fair experimentation model based on copyright law exemptions, the introduction of a licensing system, the adoption of an open source model that emphasises the public good associated with the scientific research, the use of patent pools and, finally, a re-interpretation of the nature of patent rights themselves) each have their advantages and disadvantages. This review considers that any proposed exemption should provide greater clarity for researchers, avoid unnecessary rigidity in its interpretation, not unreasonably impede either scientific development or investment in research, not reflect a substantial shift in the understanding and application of patent law, and contribute to the international harmonisation of patent law. 5. Overall, two conclusions may be drawn from this Report. First, more research is needed to ascertain what is the optimal form of any research exemption. Second, the imperatives that give rise to the need for an exemption  sound economic policy and scientific innovation  require that care be taken in the formulation of any exception to the rights of patent-holders.	research exemptions *** patent law *** patent law *** scientific research *** patented inventions *** patented inventions *** scientific research *** research exemptions *** intellectual property *** scientific research *** research investments *** patent law *** research exemptions *** patented knowledge *** research use	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)16	SUMMARY OF COUNTRY RESPONSES TO THE TIP QUESTIONNAIRE ON POLICY RESPONSES TO GLOBALISATION	2005	R	1. The globalisation of Research and Development  facilitated by new ICT, efficient transportation, and a certain convergence in governance norms  is becoming an increasingly important but still insufficiently understood dimension of the overall process of globalisation. The ongoing OECD project on globalisation of Research and Development aims to: take stock of the state and development of the globalisation of Research and Development; discuss related policy issues; to identify good practices; contribute to the creation of conditions that support mutually beneficial outcomes of internationalisation in Research and Development; and improve the measurement of globalisation of Research and Development, including through the development of new indicators. 2. In order to better understand Member Countrys policy responses to the challenges and opportunities related to the globalisation of Research and Development, a questionnaire was circulated in November 2004. In total, responses from 13 Member Countries have been received1. First use of results of this survey was made in the Background Report for the Brussels Forum on Internationalisation of Research and Development jointly organised by the OECD and the Belgian Government (March 29-30th 2005). 3. This document goes beyond this first attempt by summarising in more detail the information contained in the responses to the questionnaire. Following the framework of the above mentioned Background Report (see Box 1), this document reviews national policy frameworks and strategies concerning the internationalisation of Research and Development as well as five major policy domains: support for new Research and Development activities via foreign direct investment (FDI); linking domestic firms to foreign sources of research and innovation, treatment of foreign firms or foreign research institutions in Research and Development-related policies; support for the internationalisation of domestic public research organisations (PROs) outside the university sector and universities; and policies toward foreign talents. It has to be noted that given the limited number of responses, and the fact that some important players in the globalisation of Research and Development did not answer, this survey of policies is preliminary and provides only a partial picture	globalisation of research *** globalisation process *** good practices *** internationalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** internationalisation of research *** policy frameworks *** research organisations *** policy domain *** research organisations *** internationalisation of research *** foreign direct investment *** foreign firms *** research and development activities *** globalisation of research	internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)2	INNOVATION IN PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY: SYNTHESIS REPORT	2005	R	Innovation policies and sectoral innovation systems Building on previous work on national innovation systems, the OECD Case Studies in Innovation are designed to complement generic innovation policies, which may have limited effects within the distinct context of a specific area of technology or sectoral innovation system. Hence the challenge for innovation policy is to develop a consistent and transparent policy mix which is adapted to the specific characteristics, acknowledging sectoral differences in innovation systems. Biotechnology has become the driving force of dramatic changes of the innovation process in various sectors. This is illustrated best by the pharmaceutical industry where the traditional chemical paradigm of drug discovery and development is being replaced by a new biotechnological paradigm. This has important consequences for the structure and functioning of the biopharmaceutical innovation system: biotechnology firms and public sector research organisations are becoming key actors generating the new knowledge, tools and substances for the pharmaceutical industry. Regulations, standards, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT schemes have to deal with new types of components, and on the demand side new solutions for so far unmet needs are emerging. For this reason the biopharmaceutical sectoral innovation system was chosen as one of the pilot sectors of the OECD Case Studies in Innovation (the others are: Energy technology and Knowledge-intensive Service Activities  KISA). Aims of the case study The general aim of the biopharma case study was to provide a systematic comparison of biopharmaceutical sectoral innovation systems in OECD countries. On the basis of a cross-country analysis and an explanation of the national differences, policy conclusions were drawn designed to balance between horizontal innovation policies and measures that take into account the sectoral or technological characteristics of the biopharmaceutical innovation processes. In particular, the specific characteristics of the national biopharmaceutical innovation systems, especially the structure and dynamics of innovation networks and the role of demand factors and markets were to be investigated, including the influence of government incentives and other governmental/public framework conditions and an assessment of the performance of the system. Second, the study aims at developing recommendations that enhance the effectiveness of policies to encourage the economic performance of the national biopharmaceutical innovation systems. Systemic imperfections are addressed in the investigation and in the policy recommendations. A case study approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods To advance the understanding of innovations systems requires a methodology which enables us to study these systems in depth as well as to compare various innovation systems. The explorative and comparative nature of the study renders a case studies approach the most appropriate. A case study requires the description of the working, structure and dynamics of a sectoral innovation system in developing, producing and delivering products and services to satisfy demand by users and consumers, and the way a   sectoral system changes over time. However, a methodology which enables to systematically compare across innovation systems, also requires quantitative information. In order to facilitate comparability across countries a common methodology was developed for the national case studies combining qualitative and quantitative methods. National reports  following a common structure  have been prepared for Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Japan and Spain.. National performance in science and innovation The performance analysis shows that in terms of overall scientific performance smaller countries  Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands  and the United Kingdom take a leading position. Japan and Spain are ranked at the end of this scale, both performing less well than the European average. The output of education systems in the health sector seems not to be tightly related to scientific output. Only the Netherlands also show a rather high share of PhDs in the health sector. Better matches between education output and scientific performance can be observed for life sciences were three of the best-performing countries  Belgium, Finland and the United Kingdom  are also leading in terms of fraction of PhDs in life sciences in all PhDs. In terms of innovation performance measured as patent applications and number of drugs in the pipeline, Belgium, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are among the leading countries. Spain, Japan and Norway on the other hand, seem not to perform that well. Combining both performance categories reveals different country clusters. It shows that Belgium is the best performer; it scores highest in innovation and industry and second in science. Finland and the Netherlands are rather strong in science but have a medium performance in innovation development. Germany is relatively well performing in innovation development and less in science. France and Norway are not excelling in either science or innovation development but France still performs better in innovation development and Norway better in science. Japan and Spain are performing poorly in both science and innovation development. Structure and dynamics of national biopharma system: openness The openness of national pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical systems can be studied from different points of view. Looking at trade in pharmaceuticals it can be argued that this indicator tells us very little about the openness of the innovation system due to the existence of parallel markets. Nevertheless, this indicator shows that Finland, Japan, Norway and Finland tend to be more import-oriented while France, Germany, and the Netherlands tend to be more export-oriented. Activities of large multinational pharmaceutical companies help explain these patterns. When regarding the activities of multinational pharmaceutical companies it shows that the value added of pharmaceutical production was predominantly realised by foreign-owned firms in France, Norway and Spain, while domestic enterprises were more prominent in Finland and the Netherlands. However, very few of the small dedicated biotechnology firms were foreign-owned, reflecting the domestic origin of these firms as spin-offs from universities, public research organisations and other firms. The third and fourth indicators for openness focus on the international dimension of collaboration. The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most global industries in terms of alliances and collaborative activities. The surveys of dedicated biotechnology firms found that a majority of these firms that were involved in collaborative arrangements with other firms had foreign partners. The percentage of patent applications in biopharmaceuticals that involve international cooperation was high in Europe when compared to the United States and Japan. During the late 1990s there was a noticeable shift toward relying more on domestic knowledge sources, but this appears to be caused by the entry of many new dedicated biotech firms that were spun off from universities, firms, etc. Biotech firms active in the biopharmaceutical sector that do not have alliances with the large pharmaceutical firms also tend to rely more heavily on the domestic sources for their innovative activities, including on universities and public research organizations.   Structure and dynamics of national biopharma system: demand-side factors The analysis of the role of the demand side in national innovation systems conceiving demand as market pull in the broad sense shows that while market size may function as an attraction to industry, it is not necessarily conducive to innovation. This is because even less innovative products may be sold in suitable volumes. In a more narrow sense and corresponding to the lead market concept, a market may have a pull effect if it is a demanding market by way of requiring sophisticated products. Such requirements may be put forward by customers themselves or by their representatives, i.e. physicians, or they may be posed by regulating authorities. The necessity of cost containment measures do, however, more often dictate a different strategy, where there are hardly any incentives towards attracting innovative products. Rather, the incentives towards the usage of generic products dominate. This may in turn lead to a safer strategy on behalf of the industry, since the risk of failure in financial terms may escalate to intolerable levels with the existence of strict cost containment policies in addition to conventional risks. One other main finding is that user influence is of an extremely limited nature in all countries studied. This is perhaps not surprising given the complex nature of the products in question. In order to stimulate diversification and proliferation of innovative products, a differentiation according to more detailed and niche-based principles rewarding innovation may be warranted for in the future. Structural and dynamic characteristics explaining the performance of the systems Only few structural and dynamical characteristics of the national science system explain why the best perform better in science than the rest. It can be concluded that only limited similarities in structural factors (mostly in the political system) have been found that could be related to the science performance level of one of the country groups. A number of structural factors of the national innovation system seem to have some explanatory value for innovative performance. These are the maturity of the national private equity markets, the existence of policies and instruments for the commercialisation of technology and the biotechnology-specific character of these commercialisation policies. In both cases these factors belong to the framework and institutional subsystem and the policy subsystem. Factors belonging to the science system, the business system and the demand system do not seem to have any impact on performance levels. The outcomes show that policies to create and sustain the knowledge base are also crucial for commercialisation, but the reverse is not true. Countries having a comprehensive policy approach in a sense that they are using a broad set of policies to promote biotechnology that address all functions of the innovation system perform better than countries with patchy and fragmented policies. Policy recommendations The role of the governments in innovation policy making has changed considerably over the last decades. Based on the linear model of innovation, first generation innovation policy in the post-war period were focused on funding RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, especially basic  i.e., generally applicable  research as its major policy instrument. This funding  at a certain distance from the market  was designed compensate for market failures, leading companies to under-invest in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT due to the existence of spillovers caused by their limited ability to appropriate the returns, to indivisibility associated with the existence of minimum efficient scale, and the uncertain character of innovations. Since the mid-1990s the complexity of the innovation system requires governments to address systemic failures. Recognition was given to the diffusion of innovation, the interactive character of the innovation process (with many feedback loops between the different stages of the process) and the regional and/or sectoral specificity of innovation processes. Policies are designed to address systemic failures which block the functioning of the innovation process. These failures provide a rationale for government involvement not only through the funding of basic research, but also  and here the second generation innovation policies comes in  more widely in ensuring that the innovation system performs well as an entity.   A new role of government involvement in the coming years is to recognize the importance of innovation in the political system itself. The focus of first and second generation policies was on the research and education system, the business system, framework conditions, infrastructure and intermediaries. The focus of third generation policies will be on government itself. An important function is to close the co-ordination gap within the government between the separate departments that each deal with specific aspects of the innovation chain, but also between national, international and regional governments. Given the systemic failures that have been identified in the national biopharmaceutical innovation systems in the national case studies and the need for an integrated innovation policy approach that includes first, second and third generation policies, recommendations have been formulated that address:  Coherent and consistent innovation policies: Combine objectives such as improving international competitiveness through biopharma innovation policies on the one hand and a high quality and affordable public health care system on the other hand.  Public governance: Facilitate a more active role of patients and/or their organisations in innovation processes, clinical trails and market access; important sources of innovations remain unused until so far.  Promoting cooperation and networking: Create network links throughout the biopharma innovation system, especially between actors in the sciences and the business system.  Support for an innovative industry: Develop instruments that provide incentives for private financers to invest in new and young biopharma firms.  Regulatory framework: Develop transparent and stable regulations, with short application procedures and good information supply on procedures and the development of an adequate system for protecting biopharma innovations.  Technology transfer: Stimulate the exploitation of public sector biopharma research, include INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT indicators in review and evaluation procedures, install qualified supportive infrastructure for start-ups (legal, business, marketing expertise, incubator and technical facilities).  Stimulate sound science systems. The market imperfections associated with basic research still persist, which provides a role for governments research policies and funding.	national innovation systems *** policy mix *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** new knowledge *** public research sector *** research organisations *** innovation systems *** demand-side policies *** intellectual property *** knowledge intensive services *** technological knowledge *** energy technology *** service activities *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** horizontal innovation policies *** framework conditions *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation performance *** industrial innovation *** innovation systems *** research organisations *** innovation activities *** public research *** national innovation systems *** demand-side policies *** innovative products *** innovative products *** innovative products *** science system *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** technology commercialisation *** science system *** knowledge base *** policy approaches *** innovation systems *** funded research *** model of innovation *** policy instruments *** market failures *** systemic failures *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** diffusion of innovation *** systemic failures *** innovation process *** innovation systems *** basic research *** framework conditions *** education and research *** systemic failures *** policy approaches *** health care *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** innovation systems *** public sector *** technology transfer *** intellectual property *** science system *** basic research	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)3	THE MONIT PROJECT: MAIN MESSAGES	2005	R	24. The results from MONIT illustrate a number of dilemmas and implications for innovation policy governance in OECD countries. Developments like globalisation, a more innovation-driven economy, structural changes, ageing of populations, tight fiscal constraints etc, drive governments to long term changes in their innovation systems and socio-institutional changes in governance and policy-making. 25. Governments experience several dilemmas in this process, for example  Significant tensions between disparate cultures, priorities and constituencies signify that traditional governance structures are under pressure. Governments must manage these tensions with the aim to create a legitimate basis for coherent agenda setting.  History counts and represents strong inertia in governance. Governments need to renew governance and institutions, and these adjustments are difficult to induce as corporatist and other influences take part in prioritization.  Many countries experience a great need to develop long term strategies for growth and change, but may lack institutional resources and mechanisms to do so. Perceived challenges are all too often not met as inherent short-termism take hold. 26. The material presented in this report point to a number of issues that need to be addressed in a 3rd generation innovation policy. They hint at some important capabilities for governments: 27. Balancing imperatives: Although innovation policy in general can rest on supportive imperatives among most policy areas, not all have the same growth imperative as innovation policy. For example, social and environmental policy, or in general policy for sustainable development, have different or even opposing objectives and imperatives. The increasing debate on climate change and carrying capacity makes in necessary for government to promote a growth model where economic growth is decoupled from environmental and social pressure. 28. Creating visions that communicate: Political leadership has a strong integrative potential. Visions play an important role in this, as they communicate rationales, objectives and preferences, and as such create a legitimate basis for priorities that may be difficult to argue for or even justify. Effective visions will also help co-ordination between ministries and agencies as a joint understanding of common efforts is more easily supported. 29. Developing appropriate knowledge bases: The innovation systems approach argue strongly for networking and collaboration between agents in the system. This is no less relevant in the case of the 3rd generation innovation with its focus on broader, comprehensive agendas. To overcome inherent inertia, governments should pay attention to the appropriateness of the knowledge base and to what degree this base is segmented and slows down integrated approaches to system and industrial development. 30. Developing a strategic, horizontal approach: While many countries lack a strategic focus, others have established institutions like chabadi chabado councils. The implication from the MONIT material indicates that even these may be too narrow as they often concentrate on core STI policies. A strategic, horizontal approach needs to include and develop the innovation policy potential in other ministerial domains and ensure a co-ordinated division of labour between them.   31. Integrating learning in governance practices: Governments need to organise strong knowledge support to achieve horizontal as well as vertical coherence. Whereas this points to managing an appropriate knowledge base and include it for policy purposes, the MONIT material also implies that governance and co-ordination modes as such may be better aligned with learning needs. In particular, governments should develop approaches to introduce what in this report is termed inherent policy making that combines learning with decentralisation and increased self-organisation. 32. Develop and implement action plans with monitoring and reporting systems: A third generation innovation policy cannot be properly implemented without precise targets and intelligent follow-ups. Governments should increase their capacity to develop actions plans derived from horizontal, strategic approaches and translate these into concrete measures to be taken by each ministry or agency. Thence, vertical coherence will be enhanced and additionally supported by empirical facts through monitoring and indicator systems in combination with sound reporting to the strategic apex. 33. Designing agencies: As most governments have introduced New Public Management practices, the design of agencies and their interface with their principals (ministries) become crucial. Governments should design these agencies with the aim to create an effective division of labour between the two layers. While governments should retain long term policy competence, they should give agencies sufficient degree of flexibility to warrant coherent and timely implementation of policies and programmes. In particular, micro-management of these agencies is counterproductive if the goal is to achieve coherent governance. 34. Improving evaluation and learning: The evaluation practices in MONIT countries are mostly piecemeal and far less geared towards informing policy than the apparent potential. In general, governments should create a solid basis for evaluation and learning and integrate these into the policy making process. This includes also evaluation of broader reforms where knowledge about innovation impacts is useful for feedback and policy formulation. A more holistic approach to evaluation and learning will enhance the reflexive capabilities in the governance system and lead to more effective policy. 35. Developing pragmatic state-private sector interfaces: Over the years, the interface between the state and the private sector has shifted from strong interventions by the state up until the early 1980s, to much weaker ones under the current dominance of New Public Management. While sound macro- economic policies and framework conditions are a must in modern innovation policy, there is a great potential for more pragmatic interfaces. These could include balanced stakeholder mechanisms as well as cluster policies where the potential for packaging a number of policy areas for a given cluster is greater. Effective interfaces are not least necessary when there is a need to leverage longer term priorities and manage transitions in structures and infrastructures. 36. Finally, the two years of the MONIT project have left several questions unanswered. Seeing the NIS project and the MONIT project as a continuity, some directions for further work are indicated: 37. Evaluation and learning practices, as these lie at the heart of comprehensive, coherent policy making. The MONIT project has illustrated that there are insufficient attention to these practices, and a joint effort in the TIP working party may make a contribution. 38. Agency management and policy implementation, as continuing restructuring and development of governance practices indicated that the agency level is gaining in importance but lacking appropriate focus of their role in particular implementing policies in a setting with multiple principals. 39. Integrating mechanisms between policy areas, in particular tools for mutually supportive policies and instruments.   40. Stakeholder participation, including both at the policy level through various councils or other influencing practices, as well as in programme management and project selection. Such work should also focus on the impacts in terms of inherent priorities, preferences for established industries and long term commitments. 41. Improved methods for country peer reviews of policy mixes and governance practices, as it becomes more important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a national innovation and governance system on its own merits in addition to learning and benchmarking based on indicators.	governance arrangements *** innovation systems *** governance arrangements *** policy areas *** environmental policy *** sustainable development *** economic growth *** knowledge base *** innovation systems *** knowledge base *** governance arrangements *** knowledge base *** new public management *** policy implementation *** policy formulation *** private sector *** new public management *** framework conditions *** policy areas *** governance arrangements *** policy implementation *** policy areas *** governance arrangements *** policy mix *** peer review	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)4	PEER REVIEWS OF Public Private Partnerships FOR INNOVATION: MAIN MESSAGES	2005	R	1. A major conclusion of the OECD Growth Study was that governments need to be more responsive to the rapid transformation of innovation processes and related business needs and strategies, and that greater use of Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) can increase this responsiveness and therefore enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of technology and innovation policy. As a follow-up of the growth study, the CSTP launched a project to assess trends in Public Private Partnerships and identify good practices in their design and management. This project started with the preparation of a report on Public Private Partnerships for innovation: policy rationale, trends and issues, partly based on the results of a questionnaire, which served as a background paper for an international conference hosted by the Mexican government in Puerto Vallarta on December 2002. It was subsequently carried out as part of the DSTI- wide project on Micro-Policies for Productivity and Growth and consisted of peer reviews of national experiences with Public Private Partnerships. The role of Public Private Partnerships in the innovation policy of Austria, Australia, France, the Netherlands and Spain, with a focus on flagship Public Private Partnership programmes,1 has been accordingly examined at three TIP meetings (June and December 2003, December 2004), with a view to deriving lessons that can be useful to all countries considering new initiatives or policy reform in this area.2 Country reports were subsequently prepared and published. A preliminary synthesis of the results of the first four peer reviews was presented and discussed at the June 2004 TIP meeting and provided the substance for a chapter on Public Private Partnerships in the 2004 STI Outlook. 2. The Secretariat now intends to prepare a publication which will synthesise the main outputs of the Public Private Partnership project. A draft outline of this planned publication is set out in the Annex. The following highlights some of the main lessons learned from the Peer reviews	public private partnerships *** innovation process *** good practices *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** peer review *** public private partnerships *** private partnerships in sti *** public private partnerships *** peer review *** public private partnerships *** peer review *** public private partnerships *** peer review	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)5	ACTIVITIES report to CSTP	2005	M	TIP activities cluster into two general categories: i) projects aimed at implementation of the NIS approach in policy making; and ii) Analytical work on selected policy issues and mechanisms. Under the implementation of the NIS approach 5 activities have been conducted: (1) Sectoral case studies on innovation (pharmaceutical biotechnology and energy technology, fuel cells in particular; A cross-sectoral synthesis report will be drafted by the Secretariat, in consultation with the expert groups, to draw conclusions about the balance between horizontal innovation policies and more customised measures that take into account sector-specific characteristics of innovation systems). (2) Knowledge-intensive service activities (explore how firms in different industries make use of KISAs in their innovation processes. industry sectors covered : software, health care services, recreation and tourism and traditional resource-based  industries (e.g. aquaculture, mining). A draft integrative synthesis report that draws lessons from the sectoral reports is being prepared for presentation and discussion at the TIP meeting in June 2005. (3) Monitoring the implementation of horizontal innovation policies (MONIT, focus on the ways in which countries organise and co-ordinate innovation policies in domains that span multiple government ministries, such as information society, sustainable development, transportation, and regional development). (4) Innovation policy and performance (A consultant paper was prepared that outlined a methodology for assessing innovation performance and policy, using a framework based on a national innovation systems approach. Six countries volunteered to prepare detailed country notes. Final country reports were completed in spring 2004, and a synthesis report was prepared and presented to the TIP). (5) Policy mixes for innovation (TIP intends to implement a series of peer reviews to examine the mixes of policy used in  different countries to foster innovation. The TIP project would produce a series of country-specific reports summarising the results of the peer reviews, as well as a synthesis report that draws key lessons that can be applied by other countries). Under the Examination of specific innovation policy instruments, 4 main activities have been conducted : (1) PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for innovation (During 2003 and 2004, the TIP engaged in a series of peer reviews of country experiences with Public Private Partnerships for research and innovation to identify critical factors that influence the efficiency of Public Private Partnerships, and derives practical lessons for national policies and international co-operation), (2) Financing of business Research and Development (changing patterns of public and private financing of business Research and Development and their implications for innovation policy ; moving to the development of a methodology for evaluating the effects of government policy interventions (e.g. direct financing of business Research and Development, tax incentives) on business Research and Development strategies/behaviours. With a conceptual paper and pilot evaluations by a dozen countries) (3) Intellectual property rights and innovation (TIP contributions consisted of analytical work that made use of the newly developed OECD Patents database, results of TIP work on IP management in PROs, and a survey of business perceptions of patenting and licensing, with a A policy-oriented report summarising key results of work to-date). (4) Innovation in services (Work began in early 2004 to examine Research and Development patterns  in  service  sector industries. A questionnaire was used to collect information from member countries about policies and programmes to stimulate innovation in services, and An interim report summarising this work was presented to the TIP in June and included as a chapter in the STI Outlook 2004.). To these must be added two emerging activities on the evaluation of innovation policy an on the internationalisation of Research and Development.	national innovation systems *** fuel cells *** innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** horizontal innovation policies *** energy technology *** knowledge intensive services *** innovation process *** service activities *** health care *** business sector *** sustainable development *** horizontal innovation policies *** innovation performance *** national innovation systems *** policy mix *** peer review *** peer review *** international co-operation *** business research and development *** peer review *** policy interventions *** public private partnerships *** policy instruments *** business research and development *** development strategies *** tax incentives *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** business sector *** innovation in services *** innovation in services *** internationalisation of research	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_global_challenges *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)6/REV1	THE ROLE OF KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE SERVICE ACTIVITIES IN INNOVATION: FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT	2005	R	The study of knowledge-intensive service activities (KISA) is a case study in innovation, undertaken as part of the OECDs continuing work on national innovation systems. The project provides a new perspective on innovation policy and innovation system thinking by examining the value of KISA in facilitating the growth of innovation capacity within recipient organisations. Rather than focusing on service sector industries, per se, the KISA study focuses on the role of knowledge-intensive services as carriers and sources of knowledge that influence the performance of individual organisations, value chains and clusters across industries. From this perspective, the impact of services on innovation performance is understood through their specific functional role rather than as a set of distinct industry sectors. As defined in this study, KISA refers to the production and integration of service activities undertaken by firms or public sector actors in the context of manufacturing or services, in combination with manufactured outputs or as stand-alone services (OECD 2001:2; OECD 2003; OECD 2004). Typical examples of KISA include research and development (Research and Development), management consulting, ICT services, human resource management and employment services, legal services (including those related to INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT) accounting, financing, and marketing-related service activities. Most businesses and public sector organisations make use of such KISA in their daily operations, whether they provide them internally and/or source them from external suppliers in the private or public sectors With more than 230 personal interviews and survey data from over 1000 respondents, the KISA project is a major research undertaking. The study involved 11 countries, nine of which contributed to the production of total of more than 20 case studies examining KISA in four broad industry groups: 1) software services, 2) tourism and leisure, 3) health care, and 4) resource-based industries.1 Together these studies provide a diverse range of industrial settings in which to examine and better understand the role of KISA in innovation. They provide considerable insight into KISA-related processes that underlie innovation capabilities and performance of firms and organisations  subtle processes do not lend themselves to traditional statistical analysis. The key aim of the KISA project was to generate a comparative analysis of different kinds of service inputs to the management of innovation in firms. As an exploratory effort, the study followed an open approach that aimed to further develop key analytical concepts and allow an understanding of the processes related to KISA. There were two original research questions: i) What kinds of KISA occur in different countries and industries? ii) How do KISA work? The first question was the target of survey research, while the second was examined by firm-level case studies of firms. This report identifies key lessons from the case studies, highlighting the importance of KISA to innovation policy and offering insight into ways to build the KISA perspective into innovation policy.   1 Nine countries  Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway and Spain  conducted empirical studies for the KISA project. In addition, the United Kingdom and Czech Republic provided national data for the project and actively supported the KISA focus group.   KISA in innovation The implicit assumption of the KISA project is that service activities have a role in innovation processes. This can occur in several different ways. For example, KISA can be a source of innovation if it plays a role in initiating and developing innovation activities in client organisations. Alternatively, KISA may be a facilitator of innovation if it supports an organisation in the innovation process, such as in a case in which the innovation does not originate from the KISA supplier, nor is it transferred from an external organisation to the client organisation. Similarly, KISA can be a carrier of innovation playing a role in transferring existing knowledge among or within organisations, industries or networks, so that it can be applied into a new context. The different roles of KISA depend partly on the response of the client organisation: how it engages with the supplier of the service, how it retains learning from the service, and how it manages knowledge throughout the organisation. All these features are part of the interactive nature of the service process. The variety of methodological approaches used in the study generated rich empirical material that highlights some key insights about KISA in the innovation processes in the analysed sectors. : KISA affects innovation processes in different ways. The case studies indicate that different types of KISA contribute in different ways to innovation (Table 1). Some KISA, such as Research and Development and strategic management aim at firm renewal. Such renewal services are closely linked to innovation, but are relevant and accessible to a limited number of highly capable recipient organisations equipped with sufficient resources. Other, more routine services, such as accounting help maintain and improve existing systems and activities within organisations. Their significance for performance development is highly important for most organisations. Compliance services, such as auditing and some legal services are not obviously linked with innovation but they offer an access route to a wide range of organisations, among them the bulk of small businesses that may not make significant use of other types of KISA By developing the quality and range of services offered through this established relationship, a large number of organisations could benefit from KISA and up- grade their innovation capacity. Network services provide an important platform for knowledge exchange within formal and informal networks. They also represent a flexible resource base for the members of the network. Table 1. Types of KISA and their role in innovation Renewal services Directly related to innovation, for instance Research and Development and strategic management consulting Routine services Contribute to improvement of maintenance and management of various subsystems within organisations, e.g. accounting Compliance services Help organisations to work within the legal framework and various other regulatory regimes, e.g. auditing and some legal services Network services Facilitate communication, knowledge exchange and flexible resource allocation, e.g. informal personal networks and production related networks  The use of KISA varies across industries and across time Reflecting their different roles, KISA are used to different degrees by firms in different sectors and at different points in the innovation process. Services related to Research and Development are important in early stages of innovation, while those related to intellectual property rights, commercialisation, marketing and production processes tend to be more important during later stages of the innovation life cycle. In the software sector, for example, most software firms specify, design and implement new products using internal resources.   The first outside service they typically seek is assistance with strategy formulation and finance, followed by legal services. Examples of other important KISA used at different points in the innovation process are consulting and research services related to strategy, business development, engineering IT, marketing, and financing. As shown in the leisure and tourism study, three central challenges in innovation include the integration of various kinds of expertise in product development, the integration of style and technology, and the role of the customer/user and the importance of understanding emerging lifestyles. All of these involve knowledge-intensive service activities. The role of KISA in innovation, therefore, depends on a number of dimensions, including the nature of the organisation, characteristics of the value chain, type of the industry and the life cycle of the innovation. In the case studies, the type of KISA needed within a firm, irrespective of sector, was found to be closely related to the stage of the innovation life cycle. Innovation is a collective process that requires access to multiple skill sets The KISA study illustrates the degree to which innovation is an interactive process among various participants. KISA influence innovation via collective or collaborative problem-solving processes in which organisations work together to meet a market need or opportunity. Since innovations tend to be increasingly complex, a wide set of skills is an ever more crucial element of success. For instance, the development of a new type of printing paper brings together a diverse range of KISA including expertise in: fibre research, biotechnology, chemistry, electronics, engineering, business management, marketing, logistics, key clients, software development and printing technology. Such examples highlight the multidimensional nature of innovation and the diverse range of KISA needed to bring it to fruition. Innovative firms must mobilise a wide set of skills, often extending beyond the internal capabilities of any individual organisation. These skills include not just technical skills, but market analysis, logistics and behavioural sciences. Indeed, as product-based businesses continue to transition towards offering solutions that contain a growing service content (as in resource-based industries), the interaction of internal and external KISA play a key role in building businesses capabilities and in shifting the focus of innovation from technological innovations to non-technological ones. The large number of KISA needed for actors requires specialist management skills, such as orchestration of external service providers. Users and customers are important drivers of innovation. The KISA study highlights the importance of users and customers in the innovation process. They are important partners for learning, and often new knowledge is developed in the relationship between a firm and its customers. In the software report, for example, ideas for new software products were most often found to come from interaction between software suppliers and customers. Interaction with users also helped suppliers to develop their internal skills as users participated in joint problem solving and product development. Overall, users had a significant role in networks, which were very important KISA actors in the software sector. In the leisure industry innovation revolves around consumers leisure pursuits and needs to be based on an understanding of consumer lifestyles and everyday practices. In resource-based industries, too, the increasingly customer-driven nature of innovation is shifting the strategic focus towards the customer end of the value chain. For production-driven firms this means that a wide range of new types of skills needs to be developed with the assistance of internal and external KISA. Related to the importance of users is the importance of marketing services as a driver of innovation in some industries. The tourism and leisure report emphasises the importance of marketing services as builders of internal innovation capacity in tourist businesses. A new set of marketing-related services provided tourism businesses with information about customers evolving lifestyles that create demand for new types of services. The tourism case studies highlighted some alignment between innovation policies and service industries.   Emergence of supplies of KISA is contingent on demand. Development of external supplies of KISA are depend on the emergence of demand for such services. In the case studies, lack of awareness of KISA was observed most frequently among small firms, many of which viewed KISA as luxuries they cannot afford or tended to see them as secondary to technological innovation. Use of KISAs was found to be higher among firms with more resources and better-developed innovation capabilities. Most such firms regarded KISA as essential to implementing innovation, highlighting a possible link between innovative capacity and willingness to use KISA. Most firms provided KISA internally, with decisions to seek external sources of KISA depending on many factors, including the size of the firm, lifecycle of the innovation process, and nature of the particular service. While many of the KISA needed to make firms more innovative exist in the private sector, governments were also found to play an important role, especially where individual firms lack needed skills for innovation and market demand for stimulating their creation is either insufficient or too diffuse. The health care report demonstrates the importance of innovation culture as a major influence on the innovation propensity and illustrates that if there is no demand for expert services, there is probably no supply either. Typically health care organisations have been run by medical professionals in a highly independent and self-sufficient manner. Market conditions have not been sufficient to for expert services to be created outside health care organisations and health care organisations themselves tend to be more capable than outside services. Diffusion of innovation is a key issue in health care, and it appears that significant innovation potential within the health care systems could be realised through more effective sharing of knowledge and good practices. One way to address this problem would be for organisations to make their expertise available to the outside, but few incentives exist for doing so. Building the KISA perspective into innovation policy Continued expansion of the knowledge economy and increased economic globalisation are likely to raise the importance of KISA in contributing to innovation. The evolving division of labour and the volume of knowledge are strong drivers of KISA. The challenge will be for innovation policies to foster the supply, demand and quality of KISA to improve innovation performance. Policies can target KISA actors directly, or indirectly through intermediary organisations, or through wider framework conditions including government regulation, education and skills development, and procurement practices. Also, the public sector itself is a significant provider and user of KISA, and hence a target for innovation policies. Table 2 presents some key dimensions that need attention when developing balanced innovation policy portfolios around KISA.   Table 2. Types of policy that can facilitate KISA-based innovation Policy related dimension Examples of innovation policy measures Direct policy intervention targeting businesses / organisations  Securing service development related private and public financing, grants and tax credits for businesses  Transfer of enabling technologies that can support the role of KISA in innovation Indirect policy intervention targeting non-business actors within the innovation system  Securing the skills base needed by service innovators  Widening the focus of RTOs towards non-technological innovations Development of framework conditions facilitating the role of KISA in innovation  Opening up of new markets for service providers  Cutting down the regulatory burden  Financing for the use of external KISA  Good practice development, standards for service quality  Cultivating services related to innovation culture Development of existing innovation policies, more service friendly  Adopting the broad innovation concept, acknowledging the value of process innovations (technological & organisational), and product innovations (goods & services)  Adapting financing and assistance criteria so that services-related innovation projects get better access to existing policies  Training and skills development in service-related innovation for actors executing the innovation policy Development of new policy measures targeting issues that are central to the development of KISA and services- related innovation  Networks and customer interaction as innovation platforms  Developing organisations that are more capable of using internal & external KISA  Research-based knowledge and a highly skilled labour force are essential framework conditions for KISA. KISA plays a crucial role in the generation and diffusion of knowledge as it applies and re-packages research-based knowledge for practical purposes. Governments can play a critical role in this process through support for fundamental, basic research. Much of the basic knowledge derives from education and training systems, which are responsible for developing a skilled labour force. Strong links to public and private sector organisations can help ensure that that education and training institution are sensitive to evolving demands for skilled labour. At the same time, innovation policy frameworks need to respond to the non-technological aspects of KISA and their impact on innovation capability. The KISA study has identified the importance of non- technological contributions to the innovation capability of firms. This suggests that the traditional Research and Development- based approach to innovation is too narrow and that innovation policies need to recognise the various types of knowledge-intensive services activities that have different roles in the innovation processes. policy needs to focus more on the interactive people-centred activities, less on the individual firm and more on developing the collective strength of the sector or network. Since typical KISA is mainly based on intangible assets, policies ought to secure sufficient supply of private and public financing for growth oriented KISA. Better understanding of the non-technological elements of innovation and the user contribution to innovation needs to be developed. Table 2 presents the main types of KISA and their typical roles in the innovation process. A key challenge is improving access to KISA. This challenge is highlighted by intangibility, complexity and difficulties in assessing the quality and suitability of the services offered prior to engaging   with them. Financial assistance is only a partial solution. Awareness of KISA needs to be developed first and knowledge asymmetries between KISA suppliers and users can be addressed, for instance, by certification of services and through publicly funded demonstration projects. Overall, policies that stimulate the demand for KISA can also trigger enhanced supply and quality of KISA. Policies should be neutral towards internal and external sources of knowledge-intensive services until there is further research on the wider impacts of outsourcing on innovativeness and skills development. Existing innovation policies should be examined and where necessary developed to ensure that they encourage capacity building and interaction within organisations. Policies that can improve firms absorptive capacity for knowledge can have a significant impact on the firms ability to use available KISA. Policy must adapt to changing needs for KISA. The need for KISA evolves as industries, organisations and innovations mature. The life cycle of the innovating organisation and of the innovation itself can be used to determine which type of KISA best facilitates further development. At different stages of the innovation life cycle, the balance between internal and external KISA may also change, implying a need for different types of policy measures. Of course, policies must aim to facilitate sensitive, trust-based interactive innovation processes without interfering with them. Subtler understanding of the appropriateness of different kinds of policy measures can be achieved through close interaction between policy design and programme delivery and attention to the needs and reactions of the beneficiaries of policy. Demand side policies that stimulate the demand for KISA are equally important as those seeking to stimulate supply and quality of KISA. Policy coordination has an essential role here, but further research will be necessary to more fully explore the most effective role of public policy in stimulating supply and demand of KISA.	knowledge intensive services *** service activities *** national innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation capacity *** knowledge intensive services *** value chains *** business

DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)7	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS AN ECONOMIC ASSET: KEY ISSUES IN VALUATION AND EXPLOITATION - BACKGROUND AND ISSUES	2005	R	63. Intellectual assets, such as patents, play a pivotal role in fostering innovation and economic growth in a knowledge-based economy. Effective management and exploitation of intellectual assets can improve business performance and competitiveness. Patents are an important element of a firms intellectual asset portfolio and are increasingly managed as assets by companies. They are increasingly utilised to access financial markets (using patents as certificates of quality or as collateral), bought, sold and traded in technology markets, notably through licensing contracts. 64. The relative novelty of these issues creates a need to improve knowledge and information, both on quantitative and qualitative, about intellectual property exploitation and valuation. It also generates demand for an integrated policy framework in order to enhance economic growth. These are exactly the needs that the conference on Intellectual property as an economic asset: key issues in valuation and exploitation will attempt to address and fulfil.	fostering innovation *** knowledge-based economy *** economic growth *** intellectual assets *** intellectual assets *** technology markets *** intellectual property *** policy frameworks *** economic growth *** intellectual property *** intellectual property	objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)8/PART1	Public Private Partnerships FOR INNOVATION: SYNTHESIS REPORT	2005	R	1. A major conclusion of the OECD Growth Study was that greater use of Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) can enhance the efficiency of technology and innovation policy. This report summarizes the results of an OECD project which assessed trends in Public Private Partnerships and identified good practices in their design and management, based on Peer reviews of Public Private Partnership policies and flagship Public Private Partnership programmes of five countries.1 Increased use of and benefits from Public Private Partnerships 2. Public Private Partnerships for research and innovation offer a framework for the public and the private sectors to join forces in areas in which they have complementary interests but cannot act as efficiently alone. Traditional in building physical infrastructures, they are increasingly popular in Research and Development and innovation policy because they can fill some gaps in innovation systems more effectively than other policy instruments. Public Private Partnerships for research and innovation can take a variety of different forms and can be used to address a number of different policy issues,2 but their major contribution is in developing the infrastructure for knowledge and technology diffusion and in supporting collaboration between private firms and public research organisations (PROs) to undertake Research and Development. 3. Public Private Partnerships have been used quite intensively for a long time by several OECD countries, such as the United States. In recent years, they have continued to expand in the OECD area, as reflected in budget allocations and programme design. New types of Public Private Partnerships have emerged in new policy areas, and many countries have implemented reforms to improve existing Science and Technology support programmes, often with the aim of deepening the partnership component. Public Private Partnerships for innovation represent now a significant and increasing share of public funding of Research and Development in some countries. 4. Public Private Partnerships are expanding because governments are eager to reap broader economic and social benefits from investments in public research by: i) improving the leverage of public support to business Research and Development through cost and risk sharing; ii) securing higher-quality contributions by the private sector to government mission-oriented Research and Development; iii) fostering the commercialisation of results from public research; and iv) upgrading knowledge infrastructures. Public Private Partnerships develop as a response to the partial failure of other policy instruments to achieve such objectives in a new environment characterised by the changing nature of Research and Development and innovation processes (e.g. increased scientific content of technological development, higher dependency of innovators on external sources of knowledge and know-how), and rapidly evolving business Research and Development strategies and social needs (e.g. health, security, environment). 5. The Peer reviews confirm that Public Private Partnerships are unique tools to promote collaborative research in areas where innovation is deeply rooted in science:  Major programmes to promote strategic Research and Development co-operation among universities, public research institutes and private firms have been launched or reinforced in many OECD countries since the late 1990s, following the pioneering example of the Australian CRC programme.  Public Private Partnership is the best approach to build innovative networks in new multidisciplinary research fields such as nanotechnology and genomics, either as standalone initiatives or as part of broader Public Private Partnership programmes. 6. In addition to providing effective springboards for frontier-end pre-competitive Research and Development in areas of strategic importance, Public Private Partnerships can contribute to other objectives and yield broader benefits:  Input and output additionality. Cost sharing arrangements and industry leadership within Public Private Partnerships translate into high leverage of public support on business Research and Development and innovation  Behavioural additionality. Public Private Partnerships have a long lasting impact on the behaviour of public and private researchers, contributing to build trust and personal networks which facilitate further formal and informal cooperation.  Improved Research and Development procurement. Public Private Partnerships can be a more effective way than Research and Development contract to mobilise private financial resources and competencies in pursuing government missions (e.g. in areas such as health and environment) when the contribution of PROs are key to success.  New avenues for commercial spill-over from public research. Public Private Partnerships provide participating firms with easier access to public research outputs, and facilitate the creation of new technology-based firms, especially spin-offs from public research, as well as the mobility of human resources between the public and private sectors.  Linking chabadu chabados with scientific research. Most innovative chabadu chabados find it difficult to establish direct contacts with universities and public labs. Public Private Partnerships can play the role of effective bridging institutions.  Improved inter-ministerial coordination on innovation issues. Public Private Partnerships can provide opportunities and incentives for improved inter-ministerial co-ordination but their design and operation may suffer from inter-ministerial competition. An efficient way to lessen this problem is to separate strategic steering from operations.3  Increased synergies between regional innovation systems. National Public Private Partnership programmes can enhance the co-operation between different local innovative clusters in order to ensure critical mass and better exploit complementarities. 7. Whereas Public Private Partnerships can potentially achieve what other policy instruments cannot, handling them is a delicate matter since they must engage in sustained co-operation partners with different managerial cultures and partly conflicting goals. The Peer reviews suggest the following critical factors of success:  Long-term commitment from both government and industry, based on a shared vision.4  Achieve critical mass but also deep reach within the National Innovation System. Public Private Partnerships should not create high-tech islands but be imbedded in local and regional innovative clusters, and benefit innovative chabadu chabados as well as large firms. Programmes to promote large Public Private Partnerships should be complemented by measures to support smaller Public Private research teams.5  Build on existing networks but do not neglect areas where potential actors are still dispersed (e.g. multidisciplary research) and/or inexperienced in accessing government support.  Implement efficient steering mechanisms that ensure a sustainable balance between public and private interests. Implementing efficient Public Private Partnerships: four key steering mechanisms 8. A major challenge in designing and managing Public Private Partnerships is to choose the appropriate fields of collaborative research and avoid drifts in the research focus during the implementation phase. The Peer reviews have identified four steering mechanisms that are key to cope with this challenge: i) competitive selection of projects and participants; ii) optimal financing; iii) efficient organisation and management; and iv) rigorous evaluation Selection of projects and participants 9. Good practices in the selection of Public Private Partnership projects and participants include:  A stringent competitive process where proposals have to compete, based on the quality of their scientific content, their industrial relevance and the soundness of their business plan. There are two options: o A pure bottom-up approach for the choice of technological areas (e.g. Austria, Netherlands and Spain). One drawback is that if one can ensure that each selected centre addresses a well-identified market failure in an important research field, from both a private and public perspective, nothing guarantees that, collectively, they cover all the areas with the highest strategic importance for the country. This is particularly apparent when, as in the Netherlands, few co-operative centres are funded. This risk is reduced with the multiplication of co-operative research centres, as in Austria, where, however, the issue of critical mass arises, especially for a small economy. o A mixed approach where top-down criteria are used to pre-determine some of the areas where Public Private Partnership are promoted (e.g. France and, to a lesser extent, Australia). Selecting close-to-market research areas entails the risk of capture by private interest or of failures in picking the winners. Engaging industry in public good types of co-operative research (e.g. in areas such as health, environment, security) requires efforts to make tangible private benefits possible, for example through spin-offs or other forms of commercialisation of research results. o Each approach has both advantages and drawbacks, much depend on specific national conditions.  International openness. Not only Public Private Partnerships should be opened up to foreign firms, but also to foreign universities and public labs when these hold critical complementary competencies.  Participation of small firms. chabadu chabados are key actors in some research areas (e.g. biotech, multimedia, etc.). In others their participation should be facilitated but not at the expense of the overall efficiency of Public Private Partnerships (e.g. consortium of chabadu chabados, separate diffusion centres), taking into account the heterogeneity of the chabadu chabados population and the associated variety of policy approaches to their support.  Prior agreement on intellectual property rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs). Government should not impose more than broad principles. Detailed contractual provisions should be left to partners. But the existence of a clear agreement among would-be partners should be made a necessary condition for government support. Optimal financing 10. In theory, an optimally designed financing mechanism should help: i) ensure efficient selection of private partners; ii) secure the desired amount and quality of Research and Development at least cost to the government; and iii) avoid opportunistic behaviour by either the government or the private partners, especially the risk of partnerships attracting second-rate projects and less qualified research teams or a drift in the research agenda towards either pure basic research or off-shore corporate research. In practice cost-sharing ratios among partners differ from country to country and there is room for improvement, especially regarding the rate of subsidisation by the central government. The Peer reviews have identified the following good practices:  Leverage. The cost-sharing arrangements should ensure high recIntellectual Property Rightocal leverage. This is the key in ensuring sustained commitment from both public and private partners.  Long-term commitment. Support from government should be guaranteed for a sufficient long period (e.g. at least 4-5 years, up to 7 years)  A ceiling to government subsidy. Its share should not exceed 50%, and that of industry should be set at a minimum (e.g. at least 20%). The contribution of public research organisations is often mainly in-kind; increased cash contribution could improve the overall governance of Public Private Partnerships.  Flexibility. The arrangements might be different from the start according to the technological field, and evolve over time as Public Private Partnerships mature. Some flexibility in financing arrangements so as to find a better match between them and the specific mission of different types of Public Private Partnerships is required as follows: o When a Public Private Partnership aims at mobilising the competencies of the private sector to improve government mission-oriented Research and Development, it will have to be supported permanently. o The same may apply to Public Private Partnerships for pre-competitive research, but with a lower rate of support o When a Public Private Partnership aims primarily at improving the leverage of public support to business Research and Development, the rate of subsidisation should be even lower, with a sunset clause. o For Public Private Partnerships whose main objective is to open new avenues for commercial spillovers from public research, different financial arrangements might be applied to different stages (e.g. launching stage, mature stage, commercialisation stage), with an effort to involve venture capital as soon as possible. Efficient organisation and management 10. In all five countries, the government imposes only minimum requirements for the organisation of Public Private Partnerships. While some take the form of central institutes (e.g. most of Austrias Kplus centres, the Institute for Metals Research and the Telematica Institute in the Netherlands, and all Technological Centres in Spain), others are virtual networks, with a lean organisation at the core and research being done at the participating research institutes (e.g. the Dutch Polymer Institute, the French RRITs and most Australian CRCs). Participants in Public Private Partnerships that build on pre-existing networks usually choose to organise as virtual institutes. Each organisational model has advantages and disadvantages and but the Peer reviews have identified the following good practices:  Customization. Different organisational arrangements (e.g. network versus co-operative research institute, or mixed form) may be warranted, depending on technological areas and preferences of partners.  Autonomy and strong industry involvement. A large degree of autonomy should be left to partners in defining the detailed research projects portfolio of individual Public Private Partnerships. Industry should generally be given the majority votes in governing boards.  Legitimacy and leadership. Public Private Partnerships should include all leading enterprises and public research centres in the relevant technological fields, and their managers should be well-known/respected figures that have a broad experience and good links with both academia and industry.  Efficient knowledge management is vitally important to minimise the risk of opportunistic behaviour and to motivate partners.  Involvement of end-users. It is important that the organisational features of a Public Private Partnership maximise interaction not only among the researchers directly involved in a project but also between them and the end users of research results in participating firms.  Visibility. The institutional form of Public Private Partnerships should help them acquire visibility at both nationally and internationally. This helps them position themselves within international networks, and creates continuous peer pressure for improvement from competing forms of public-private relations. Evaluation 11. Evaluation of public-private partnership programmes is not a straightforward task, especially because the costs and benefits of partnerships are inherently hard to measure. Benefits may be more indirect than direct, and the existence of multiple stakeholders may give rise to conflicts in terms of the objectives of evaluations. Another difficulty is the often very long timeline of expected impacts. Despite these difficulties and gaps in evaluation methodologies, Public Private Partnerships have been subjected to quite close scrutiny, especially the CRCs in Australia, Kplus in Austria and LTIs in the Netherlands. The Peer reviews have identified the following good practices:  Ex-ante, interim and ex-post evaluation are all necessary.  Assessing behavioural additionality is needed since one of the objectives of Public Private Partnerships is to promote long- lasting changes in the attitudes of both the public and private research communities.  The involvement of foreign scientific, technological and business experts is usually required, given the limited pool of national expertise, possible conflict of interests, and the global nature of markets for end-uses of research outcomes.  The evaluation has to be systemic. The portfolio of Public Private Partnerships, and not only individual Public Private Partnerships, need to be evaluated. The interaction with other policy instruments ought to be taken into account. Evaluation should be closely linked to all decision and learning processes. Evaluation shall not only inform policy makers about the economic impact of such use of budget resources, but also be inspiring for the managers of Public Private Partnerships.	public private

DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)9/ANN7	THE EFFECT OF PUBLIC Research and Development EXPENDITURE ON PRIVATE Research and Development INVESTMENT: BEHAVIOURAL ADDITIONALITY AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL	2005	R	An empirical investigation for the relationship between public and private Research and Development funding is made in this paper, in consideration that the behavior of government Research and Development and subsidy might be different in influencing the private Research and Development investment. We employed a behavioral equation for the private Research and Development investment and polynomial distributed lags for dynamic effect of public Research and Development funding. From estimation results, it is shown that the public Research and Development funding, i.e., the government Research and Development and subsidy, has significant and positive effect on the private Research and Development investment. It is also found that the long-run policy is more important in stimulating the private Research and Development investment, relative to the short-run. In particular, the effect of the government Research and Development is greater than that of the government subsidy. In the dynamic pattern, the former lasts relatively longer, up to 12 years with a peak at the ninth year after policy implementation, while we can hardly find the evidence of long-run behavior of the government subsidy.	business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** policy implementation *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** research and development expenditures	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2005)9/REV1	BEHAVIOURAL ADDITIONALITY OF Research and Development GRANTS: INTRODUCTION AND SYNTHESIS	2005	R	1. Questions about the effectiveness of government financing of business Research and Development are of growing importance to policy makers. As they seek to boost business Research and Development expenditure and improve its contribution to innovation, policy makers seek ways of evaluating not only how much additional business Research and Development spending is encourage by government support, but how government support influences the conduct and direction of business Research and Development. Does it encourage different types of Research and Development, or more collaboration in the Research and Development process? Do firms develop improved Research and Development management capabilities that lead to enduring changes in their Research and Development strategy and performance? Such issues are not typically addressed in traditional programme evaluations, which focus on questions of additional spending on Research and Development or additional outputs from the Research and Development process. Efforts to measure explicitly changes in the ways firms conduct Research and Development as a result of government policy instruments  behavioural additionality  have remained relatively under-developed. 2. Work conducted by the OECD Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) has aimed to address this deficiency by exploring methodologies for measuring behavioural additionality effects of government funding of business Research and Development. Using a common framework and conceptual understanding, twelve countries/regions implemented evaluations of the behavioural additionality effects of their Research and Development support programmes, experimenting with different methodologies. Most of the work focused on direct financing of business Research and Development. To compare results and share experiences, two workshops were organised in Manchester and Vienna in 2004-05. This document summarises the results of this work, highlighting key findings from the country studies regarding the types of behavioural effects that were induced by government funding and the methodologies for measuring them. 3. The behavioural additionality concept is providing policymakers with a useful vocabulary to explain the effects of policy interventions. It also revealed some qualitative changes in the types of Research and Development conducted by firms and the way in which they carried out the Research and Development:  A variety of behavioural additionality effects can be induced by government funding. For example, several country studies (e.g. Finland and Japan) showed that government funding not only allowed firms to accelerate the completion of Research and Development projects (enabling them to introduce new products or services into the market sooner), but encouraged firms to pursue Research and Development projects that entitled greater technological challenges that they may have been reluctant to pursue otherwise  Government funding also encouraged firms to engage in more collaboration in Research and Development projects. The German study indicated that just under half of the collaborations were established between firms as a result of government funding, and that a good fraction of these collaboration persisted after the end of the government programme. The US study showed that many consortia and joint projects were formed directly as a result of funding, and that collaboration continued beyond the participation in a government-funded project  often on a different project. 4. The studies further demonstrated that a range of different methodologies can be used for measuring behavioural additionality, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Several countries employed survey techniques to inquire about firm perspectives before, during, and after participation in a government programme. The Belgian study developed a questionnaire that was tailored to different types   of firms and involved detailed interviews with key decision-makers in firms. This approach was important to understanding how government support enters into business innovation processes. Other efforts used econometric techniques to highlight relationships between participation in a government Research and Development programme and other types of firm behaviour. A robust approach would combine multiple methodologies. 5. While most of the work focused on direct financing of business Research and Development (often cost-shared) the studies show that behavioural additionality concepts can be extended to other types of government interventions. Norway is embedding behavioural additionality into an examination of its Research and Development tax incentive. Austria is including behavioural additionality in the evaluation of programmes that aim to link public and private sector research. As such, there are opportunities to embed the behavioural additionality approach into a broader range of policy evaluations. Further work can help further develop this concept  and the methodologies for employing it and to better understand the way in which government support interacts with and affects the strategies of firms.	business research and development *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** development strategies *** behavioural additionality *** policy instruments *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** support programmes *** supporting research and development *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** policy interventions *** behavioural additionality *** new products *** government programmes *** behavioural additionality *** government programmes *** innovation process *** business innovation *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** tax incentives *** behavioural additionality *** private sector *** behavioural additionality *** policy evaluations *** behavioural additionality	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** other_policy_areas
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)1/REV1	SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY: RECENT TRENDS AT A GLANCE	2006	O	As the evidence in this paper suggests, the overall outlook for science, technology and industry remains positive. Prospects for growing investments in innovation remain strong and patterns of innovation could converge if global economic conditions remain stable. National governments are committed to increasing public investments in Research and Development and to further enhancing the efficiency of national innovation systems through improved allocation of resources, the strengthening of linkages between science and innovation and improve incentives to business innovation. Nevertheless, governments will need to remain attentive to significant changes in innovation processes and adapt policies accordingly. The resurgence of public research organisations  universities in particular  as sources of knowledge for innovation will require continued reforms to their governance to ensure that they maintain the quality of their output while contributing more to social and economic objectives. The reduction in industry funding of university research may also suggest a need for more efficient mechanisms of knowledge and technology transfer. The growth of the services sector will demand attention to a broader set of innovating organisations and to forms of innovation that are less reliant on Research and Development. The development of more open innovation processes that link business, universities and government in a tighter innovation network will demand even greater attention to collaboration and to issues of intellectual property protection. Finally, globalisation will require governments to develop national policy in a way that reflects and benefits from the expanding capabilities of OECD and non-member countries alike. In all these areas, policies for creating a skilled workforce will remain paramount.	innovation investments *** public investment in research *** business innovation *** national innovation systems *** innovation process *** research organisations *** technological knowledge *** technology transfer *** services sector *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** innovation process	objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)10	POLICY TRENDS IN RESPONSE TO GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION	2006	R	1. This paper presents the main Science and Technology policies implemented in OECD countries in response to the challenges and opportunities that arise from the globalisation of Research and Development and the emergence of a more open and networked model of innovation in the business sector. The policies described in this paper are mainly based on the responses to the STI Outlook Questionnaire 20061. This paper is a contribution to the first module in the TIP project on Globalisation and Open Innovation which was launched in August 2006 in order to examine in detail the trends toward open innovation and globalisation of business Research and Development and their policy implications. The project consists of three modules: Module 1; synthesising previous and ongoing OECD work on the internationalisation of Research and Development and policy responses, Module 2; case studies on firm and sector level, Module 3; identifying the policy implications of globalisation and changing business strategies. The case studies of Module 2 are being carried out in collaboration with the lead countries and participating countries in the project. The companies examined in the case studies are selected from these countries as are the countries covered in this review of policy trends. In addition, it was agreed at the October 2006 launch meeting of Globalisation and Open Innovation project that another survey could be undertaken to collect additional or more up-to-date information on policies responses to globalisation and open innovation.	business sector *** globalisation of research *** model of innovation *** business research and development *** globalisation and open innovation *** internationalisation of research *** business strategies *** globalisation and open innovation *** globalisation and open innovation	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)11	THE INTERNATIONALISATION OF BUSINESS RESEARCH	2006	R	Policy recommendations for facing the challenges and opportunities raised by the internationalisation of Research and Development should take into account national policy objectives as well as the specific features of science and innovation systems. However, some general policy conclusions can be drawn:  First, if countries want to attract foreign Research and Development, it is essential to look at the economic fundamentals. Inward Research and Development investment is closely related to policies that influence attractiveness for FDI in general. Factors such as political stability, public infrastructure, market size and development, tax rates and labour market conditions are decisive in decisions to locate Research and Development. Policy should provide and secure a healthy business environment.  Second, an adequate Research and Development policy for facing the challenge of internationalisation of Research and Development should not be designed in isolation from other policies. An effective Research and Development policy implies co- ordination among various policy makers, linking Research and Development with other policy areas, particularly research and technology development (RTD), innovation, education, economic affairs and foreign affairs. Close co-operation among decision-making instances or even integration should be explored to guide prioritisation processes and to better exploit synergies in order to optimise the national innovation system (OECD, 2005c).  Third, measures to build an innovation-friendly environment and increase a country's scientific and technological capacities also help to attract foreign Research and Development. A strong and vibrant academic and industrial research base, effective protection of intellectual property rights and a well-trained workforce are major determinants of MNE investment in Research and Development but also promote the growth of domestic enterprises. Hence, these policy measures should be aimed simultaneously at domestic and foreign-owned or domiciled enterprises and should not discriminate against foreign firms.    Fourth, the creation of a framework of local conditions that foster Research and Development is crucial. Increasing the local Research and Development force can create the necessary absorptive capacity to profit from the presence of FDI in Research and Development, to attract FDI in Research and Development and to foster international networking. The provision of a strong local infrastructure for business in general and for Research and Development in particular is very important. Prior building of technological capabilities within a country's firms is crucial for their ability to interact and absorb knowledge made available by inward and outward FDI. Technological upgrading can be ensured by setting up a local infrastructure for industrial research, technological development and innovation through science parks, business incubators and technology transfer centres. Policy should try to attract and support Research and Development by providing a consistent (location- and not ownership-based) grants and tax regime, adequate IP protection (e.g. the cost to patent in the EU is still far higher than in the United States).  Fifth, human capital is a cornerstone of Research and Development. Provision of human resources is the primary task of universities but is also a task for firms. Therefore, inter-firm co-operation or co- operation between firms, universities and public research organisations focused on learning by local staff should be encouraged. An important element here is the mobility of highly skilled labour. Although policy has less influence on cultural and structural barriers, it can focus on reducing political and technical barriers such as immigration legislation, red tape, taxation and Science and Technology-related legislation. This would allow firms to make use of foreign talent and thus import important knowledge. Policies for attracting and retaining foreign highly skilled labour are a most important area of governmental policy with respect to the internationalisation of Research and Development. Policy and legislation do not drive the mobility of highly skilled labour but can facilitate or hinder it. Measures to be taken include grants, immigration legislation and tax issues. The presence of a critical mass in excellent research centres is vital for attracting experienced researchers. Ongoing work at the OECD is aimed at development of good policy practices in this context.	innovation systems *** internationalisation of research *** research and development expenditures *** labour market *** business environment *** internationalisation of research *** policy areas *** technology development *** national innovation systems *** research base *** intellectual property *** research investments *** foreign firms *** policy measures *** technology development *** business incubators *** technology transfer *** supporting research and development *** human resources *** research organisations *** technology co-operation *** skilled labour *** internationalisation of research *** skilled labour *** skilled labour *** policy practices *** business research and development	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)15	SUMMARY REPORT OF THE MADRID CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH USE OF PATENTED KNOWLEDGE	2006	W2	The conference on Research Use of Patented Inventions examined a key issue at the intersection of innovation policy and intellectual property rights: how to ensure access to inventions for follow-on research while simultaneously providing incentives to the original inventors. This topic was discussed by Ministers responsible for chabadi chabado at an OECD meeting in January 2004, at which they invited the OECD to examine the role of patent systems in fostering innovation, knowledge diffusion and competition and to assess the effect of national policies on exemptions for research use of patented inventions on the conduct of scientific research. This report summarises the presentations and discussions from the conference. The main conclusions are set out below.  (i) At present, there is no empirical evidence of a widespread problem in accessing patented inventions for research; concerns are mostly confined mostly to specific fields of research and countries. Existing concerns are limited primarily to research in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and are most pronounced in the burgeoning area of research tools in genomics and biotechnology. Many of the issues of concern are related to threats of litigation and are more worriisome in countries with traditionally high levels of litigation, such as the United States. Available empirical evidence indicates that issues of access to pure intellectual property are not   as significant as issues of access to material research inputs, owing to competition between research laboratories, among other factors. Existing evidence, however, is based on isolated surveys that tend to be limited to the United States and to the life sciences. The situation may differ in other countries and fields of research. More and better empirical evidence is needed to reach more robust conclusions. Limited  information is available on research use of patented inventions in most OECD countries. The forthcoming results from the international survey undertaken by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the framework of its Project on Science and Intellectual Property in the Public Interest (AAAS-SIPPI) will be a first step in remedying this situation as it will be based on responses from researchers in all scientific fields and four different countries (United States, Japan, United Kingdom and Germany). Preliminary results for the United States are consistent with previous surveys limited to specific areas. (ii) There are no signs of an extended slowdown in patent filings in OECD countries, and future scientific research is unlikely to take place seldom in patent-free zones in the future. Patent portfolios are likely to be built (in the public and private sectors) as a way to guarantee freedom to operate and co-operate in research. At the same time, alternative protection mechanisms are leading to the creation of informal co- operative communities (e.g. open licensing schemes, patent pools for defensive purposes) that will spread and co-exist with traditional means of IP protection. New science-based technologies will proliferate and gain increasing economic importance. Some of the issues raised in the biotechnology sector are likely to be amplified in nanotechnology and other fields. The ongoing trend towards more multidisciplinary research also heightens prospects for greater litigation over research uses. Such work brings together not only researchers from different disciplines, but also different approaches to and traditions in INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management (i.e. biotechnology and information technology in bio-informatics). The current situation of benign neglect and mutual forbearance may not be an optimal or enduring option in such an environment. (iii) A balanced patent system should facilitate inventions that build on earlier findings, but the line may be difficult to draw, especially for patented research tools. Most patent systems have research exemptions either written into their laws (statutory)  or adopted in their jurisprudence in the form of research use defences (common law). Statutory research exemptions generally allow research on the subject matter but not with it, so that use of unlicensed research tools is not exempt from infringement. Such statutory research exemptions provide clarity and security (especially when they are accompanied by statutory bans on contractual clauses undermining the scope of the exemption). Common law defences, in contrast, provide greater flexibility but less certainty, as the interpretation of the law may change over time subject to court decisions. Uncertainty and international differences as regards the scope of research exemptions in patent systems may hinder firms and other research organisations that perform Research and Development globally from benefiting from research exemptions given potential litigation risks. The balance between providing sufficient incentives to initial and follow-on inventors is greatly facilitated by the granting of high-quality patents characterised by a sufficient level of inventiveness and an appropriate level of protection relative to their contribution to the state of  the art (e.g. claims granted only for disclosed specific uses). (iv) Alternative mechanisms to facilitate access to inventions for research purposes are also available. Other government policies can also facilitate access. Competition policy can be used to guarantee affordable and widespread licensing of foundational inventions and essential research tools protected by patents by monitoring the behaviour of licensors. Governments often retain the right to inventions developed with government funding or can require compulsory licensing in certain situations. Other models of intellectual property management are also gaining ground and seek to create communities of users and foster collaborative innovation among them via improved sharing of patented inventions. The Open Invention Network, for example, acquires patents related to open source software and makes them available royalty-free to others who agree not to assert related patents. The Science Commons Licensing Project explores how standard open agreements can facilitate licensing of intellectual property and exchange of materials. (v) Further studies are needed to better understand emerging issues related to research access to patented inventions and identify good practices for promoting it across different industry sectors and countries. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, more work needs to be done to better define, measure and delineate the problem of research use of patented inventions. Studies could focus on specific issues in the research tools industry or on emerging problems  in interdisciplinary fields. Of particular interest would be efforts to determine how different legislative and regulatory environments affect innovation, economic growth and the location of Research and Development activities. There is also need to identify good practices for facilitating access to patented inventions, for example, as regards research tools in biotechnology, as well as patented inventions based on publicly funded research results. Theoretical and empirical research for the assessment, determinants and impacts of patent quality would also be important to better address the issues raised in this area.	intellectual property *** patented inventions *** research use *** fostering innovation *** diffusion of knowledge *** patented inventions *** research use *** scientific research *** patented inventions *** research tools *** intellectual property *** patented inventions *** research use *** intellectual property *** scientific research *** private sector *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** information technology *** research tools *** research exemptions *** research use *** research tools *** research exemptions *** research exemptions *** research organisations *** research exemptions *** research tools *** competition policy *** intellectual property *** patented inventions *** intellectual property *** good practices *** business sector *** patented inventions *** patented inventions *** research use *** research tools *** economic growth *** research and development activities *** funded research *** research tools *** good practices *** patented inventions *** research results *** patented knowledge *** research use	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)16	PROJECT ON GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION - NEXT STEPS	2006	S	The overall objective of the project is to analyse the changing environment for business innovation, notably the move towards more open innovation and the globalization of innovation, and draw implications for policy. Module 1 will take a step-wise approach to the issue. It will first analyse the concept of open innovation along different dimensions, irrespective of the process of globalization. In a second step, globalization will be discussed separately with special attention to the internationalisation of Research and Development and innovation. Afterwards the two concepts will be brought together as they both affect the business environment and strategy of innovation, directly feeding into a discussion on possible policy implications. The characteristics of open innovation will be analysed in direct relation to the traditional closed model of innovation, focusing on topics such as the sources of innovation, multiple sourcing, commercialisation and business models. The translation of the theoretical concept of open innovation in its practical implementation will be discussed. This will include a discussion on the use and (dis)advantages of alliances, joint-ventures, spinning in and spinning out, campus development and interactions with science, the role of venture  capital, etc. Differences between industries and companies will be highlighted. the report will analyse why companies have started to use open innovation strategies. The focus will be on the different drivers of open innovation, both as regards the market (demand side) as well as on the technology (supply) side. Topics to be analysed include the role of increasing global competition, the shortening of product life cycles, the increasing multidisciplinarity of research and knowledge more generally, the growing global supply of knowledge and technology, the international mobility of researchers, the growing complexity of technology, etc. Specific attention will be devoted to the increasing importance of lead users, in accordance with the new work of Von Hippel on 'democratizing innovation'. This section may also draw on work by the EU (JRC-IPTS) on demand-side policies for innovation and the role of lead markets. The concept of globalization will be introduced by describing the importance of global value chains and their impact on companies' strategies (including innovation). The current globalization process  is driven by the fragmentation of value chains across countries and international production sharing, resulting in an increased interdependence of national markets and economies. The internationalisation of innovation will be discussed along different dimensions: Research and Development, patents, technology balance of payments, publications, human resources, etc. in order to achieve a complete picture of innovation in an international context. Similar to the discussion on open innovation, a new model of innovation (the so-called decentralized model) will be confronted with the traditional centralized model. The advantages and disadvantages of both models will be discussed in direct relation to the different drivers (market pull and technology push factors) behind the globalization of innovation. In a first step the individual drivers of open innovation and globalization will be compared, in order to identify cumulative and interdependent processes that may stimulate both open innovation and the internationalisation of innovation. The internationalisation of innovation can be thought of as focusing on one dimension of the open innovation concept, namely the trans-border dimension. Basically, the innovation strategy of a company should optimally answer questions such as: What will be innovated?: products, services, processes, for which markets. Who will innovate?: the company itself, in cooperation with suppliers, universities; by spinning- out or spinning-in, etc. How to innovate?: internally, by setting up external collaboration. Where to innovate? Close to headquarters, in developed or developing countries.	business innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation *** internationalisation of research *** business environment *** business models *** model of innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation *** demand-side policies *** open innovation *** international mobility *** life cycle *** technological knowledge *** demand-side policies *** global value chains *** value chains *** human resources *** model of innovation *** business models *** open innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation *** globalisation and open innovation	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_human_resources *** other_policy_areas *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)17/REV1	REVISED PROPOSAL FOR THE TIP WORK ON EVALUATION OF INNOVATION POLICIES IN OECD COUNTRIES	2006	S	Evaluation has become a central part of the management and governance of public support for science and innovation. The TIP plays a key role in the work on evaluation and has carried out several activities on evaluation in recent years, including a recent study on Measuring Behavioural Additionality of  Government Research and Development Support. At the TIP meeting countries expressed strong interest in the proposal, but questions were raised as regards the scope, focus, framework and assumptions in the proposal. Among the assumptions questioned was the notion of national evaluation systems. Although evaluations of research and innovation policies took place at multiple levels (e.g. policy, institutional level, instrument level) and by different actors (e.g. government agencies and ministries, universities and research institutions, research councils and non- governmental agencies) there was de facto no national evaluation system for many countries. The aim of TIP project on evaluation is to enable countries to develop a better understanding of the issues to be considered in designing and implementing their own evaluation methods and practices, drawing on practices and experiences from different countries. The project is expected to produce a set of reports covering good practices and recommendations for improving the evaluation of research and innovation policies. The project would focus on four main themes and will be organised in a modular form: Evaluation systems: architecture of evaluation systems in OECD countries. Tools for evaluation: to review changes in the tools used in advanced evaluation systems, with a special focus on the peer review mechanism in the evaluation of research and innovation policy. The evaluation process: with a focus on the internationalisation of evaluation and the use of international benchmarking at national and institution levels. The role of evaluation in priority setting. Module 1. The first module will examine the systems or the architecture of evaluation systems in different OECD countries. Analysis of the architecture of national and sub-national evaluation systems will help answer questions such as: What are the strategic goals of evaluation? What strategies are used in different countries to reach these goals? What methodologies or tactics are used to execute these strategies? Has evaluation changed the production of research? Is evaluation responsive to different cultures and contexts (e.g. basic, applied science, technology and industrial research)? Finally, does the reality of evaluation reflect the needs of science, technology, policy and industry? To enhance the comparability of case studies, a set of common variables could be examined in the case studies: frameworks for evaluation, scoping the evaluation of research and innovation programmes, managing the evaluation process, implementing the evaluation, overview of major methods, reporting on the results, and using the results of evaluation. The frameworks will also serve to gather country-specific information on the other modules of the project, i.e. in addressing: 1) how peer review methods are being used in the evaluation system and which issues this raises; 2) how internationalisation is being addressed in the evaluation system and to which extent international indicators are being used; and 3) how priorities are set, both at the strategic level and at the level of individual institutions and agencies.  In this way, the case studies would serve to reinforce the work in the other modules. Module 2. The international dimension is increasingly important in evaluation at the national level. This dimension is dual. On the hand, evaluation is comparative by nature and in a national evaluation, requires international benchmarks. On the other hand, research is by nature international and thus requires international reference points in measuring outcomes. Module 3: Peer Review in the toolkit for evaluation. From the perspective of evaluation, the peer review mechanism is a key issue. A key question is how to combine peer reviews with objective indicators for evidence-based policy. Recently, policy makers and research managers have attempted to adopt a more quantitatively and indicator based evaluation  system as a complement or substitute to peer review. The key questions are: can or should the peer review system be replaced? If so, by what? Is evaluation possible without peer review panels? Is a data based evaluation as efficient as peer review? Could an internet based open evaluation tool organized by the scientific community be an alternative to the classical approach? What kind of peer review is fit for an Research and Development institute or the evaluation of an innovation policy (e.g. direct peer review, modified direct peer review, ancillary peer review, traditional peer review, indirect peer review, pre-emptive peer review etc.)? Module 4: Priority setting and the use of evaluation findings. It could be said that priority setting, even though it draws on evaluation, is not a completely rational process but a democratic or political process where different stakeholders intervene. To some extent, evaluation can be viewed as a mere input into priority setting. Insofar as it provides a scientific basis for priority setting it is a core input because it provides alternatives to policy decision-making. It is therefore very important to understand the links between evaluation and priority setting, especially for international benchmarking.	behavioural additionality *** supporting research and development *** evaluation systems *** evaluation systems *** research organisations *** good practices *** evaluation of research *** evaluation systems *** evaluation systems *** peer review *** evaluation tools *** evaluation of research *** evaluation process *** priority setting *** evaluation systems *** evaluation systems *** evaluation of research *** evaluation process *** evaluation systems *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** evaluation tools *** peer review *** peer review *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting	other_policy_areas *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)2	RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NATIONAL SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICIES	2006	O	OECD countries continue to focus policies and financial mechanisms on stimulating science and innovation. This chapter presents the main trends in national Science and Technology and innovation policies, with a particular focus on policies and programmes introduced between 2004 and 2006. It discusses, in particular, developments related to public-sector research, government support for business Research and Development and innovation, collaboration and networking among innovating organisations, globalisation of innovation, and the evaluation of public policies to stimulate research and innovation. Where possible, it attempts to identify future trends in each of these areas, relating them to the main objectives of national policy making. As the paper illustrates, many of the recent policy developments represent a continuation of trends that were put in place earlier in the decade and highlighted in the 2004 edition of the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Outlook. While some countries have seen incremental changes in main policy trends, other countries have witnessed a significant break in past policy trends. Among the emerging trends: (1) National Science and Technology plans remain important for priority setting. Several countries have developed and introduced new national plans for chabadi chabado. Such plans provide a degree of visibility in terms of current commitments and future orientations. A new trend is that planning is increasingly taking place at sub-government ministry levels: research bodies, funding agencies and universities are increasingly required to undertake their own strategic planning exercises and to monitor progress. (2) Countries continue to develop technology foresight initiatives to identify challenges and respond to opportunities from new and emerging science and technologies. Among the countries with new foresight initiatives are Finland, New Zealand, Iceland and the United Kingdom. Such efforts help identify areas of research priority. Among the main priorities in many countries are health, ICT, energy and the environment, and more recently, security issues. Nanotechnology is also becoming more important in many countries. (3) Research and Development targets as a catalyst for stimulating public and private Research and Development. A growing number of countries have established quantitative targets for Research and Development spending, but budget deficits may constrain growth in public Research and Development. Although only a few EU countries seem on track to meet their Research and Development spending targets of 3% of GDP, the targets have nevertheless focused attention and support for innovation at the highest levels of government. Quality assessment is becoming more widespread to improve publicly funded research. Quality assessment tools aim to ensure that high quality research is funded and that research results contribute to social and economic goals. Improving access to public research data is also an issue in improving knowledge transfer and many countries are seeking to promote more open access to public research data. (4) Balancing competitive funding mechanisms with longer-term institutional funding remains an issue in countries like Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Whereas the tendency had been to shift the balance toward more competitive funding, some re-balancing toward institutional funding has become apparent. Germany recently boosted institutional funding for non-university public research organisations; New Zealand, which has leaned heavily toward competitive funding, is re-evaluating its funding mechanisms. (5) Infrastructure is attracting growing attention in many OECD countries, including Australia, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. Concerns about the sustainability of capital funding for infrastructure are not limited to universities but also include the public research institutes. (6) Streamlining and consolidating support to innovation. Countries continue boost support for business Research and Development by either direct means (e.g. grants and loans) or indirect means (i.e. tax incentives for Research and Development and early stage capital funds), but some countries (e.g. Austria, Finland, Germany, Netherlands) have streamlined and consolidated their innovation support programmes to make them simpler for industry to use. Other countries (e.g. Hungary) are concentrating resources in larger programmes rather than small scale initiatives. (7) Government support to business innovation is becoming more oriented towards fostering open innovation. Many countries have embedded concepts of networking and consortia development into their innovation support programmes and initiatives, with the aim of fostering greater collaboration among firms and between firms and public research, especially around regions and clusters. (8) Support for innovation in services. Reflecting the growing importance of services to employment and growth, many countries are examining ways to tailor access to innovation programmes to better attract service oriented firms. A few countries have special programmes for the service sector; and many others are considering ways to better design generic innovation programmes to suit the needs of the service sector. (9) Formalising knowledge transfer between universities and industry is of growing importance even in countries where industry-science relations are strong. As a result a third stream of funding is now being earmarked for knowledge-transfer activities at universities either directly or indirectly. Specific efforts are being taken to improve the management of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs at universities such as the development of guidelines and model contracts. (10) Role of sub-central governments in innovation policy is growing. A number of OECD countries are focusing attention on stimulating innovation in regions or clusters while regional governments have themselves become more active in the design and implementation of Science and Technology policies (e.g. Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, United Kingdom). (11) Persistent concerns about supply of scientists and engineers. Countries continue to report concerns about future supplies of human resources for science and technology. Several countries have taken action to improve the quality of science teaching at all levels of education. Many countries are also seeking to boost supply by attracting more women and minorities into science and technology. The international mobility of students and young researchers is also a high priority in many countries. (12) A holistic approach to evaluation is emerging. Evaluation is an essential part of the governance and implementation of science and innovation policy. While the economic efficiency and effectiveness of policies remains the main goal of evaluation, some countries (e.g. Australia, Poland, the United States) are taking a more holistic approach and focusing on social and environmental benefits of policies and not solely on the economic benefits. There is also a growing involvement of international experts or organisations in the evaluation process such as the OECD or the European University Association and the European Network for Quality Assessment (e.g. in Portugal).	business research and development *** globalisation of innovation *** policy development *** priority setting *** funding agencies *** foresight exercises *** development targets *** business research and development *** public research and development *** support innovation *** funded research *** research results *** knowledge transfer *** public research *** open access *** research organisations *** research organisations *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** support innovation *** support programmes *** business innovation *** open innovation *** public research *** support innovation *** support programmes *** support innovation *** innovation in services *** employment growth *** services sector *** knowledge transfer *** intellectual property *** stimulating innovation *** human resources *** international mobility *** evaluation process	internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)3	EVALUATION OF PUBLICLY FUNDED RESEARCH: RECENT TRENDS AND PERSPECTIVES	2006	O	Evaluation has become a central part of the management and governance of publicly funded research. A combination of factors has led to an increasing emphasis on the need to evaluate Research and Development policy. At the forefront is the recognition that in a knowledge-driven economy science and technology are key drivers of both economic competitiveness and improved quality of life for citizens. Publicly funded research programmes are now typically conceived with such ultimate aims in mind, even when the scientific work involved is of a basic nature. In this context, governments want to ensure that their investment in research is sensibly allocated and is yielding the expected return. Evaluation is the tool with which answers are sought about the scale, nature and determinants of the return. More generally, evaluation helps policymakers to better understand intended and unintended effects of policies and programmes, to learn from past successes and failures, and to rationalise decisions to continue/discontinue existing support measures or to introduce new ones. Evaluation has its own historical context and dynamics and has co-evolved with the research system, developing new approaches to deal with emergent policy instruments and concerns while at the same time helping in the design and development of these instruments. Three major trends have underpinned recent changes in evaluation practices: (1) Tighter public governance. As part of a broader movement towards improved public management, research funding has become far more conditional upon performance against specified targets, in the context of a more systematic contractualisation of the relationship between researchers and those to whom they are accountable. (2) Research as competition. Research has always had an element of competition built in, e.g. regarding publication of new findings or access to resources. Recently, other forms of competitive pressures, such as international ratings and rankings of research groups and institutions, have gained in importance and are transforming the perception of excellence in research. (3)  Increasing focus on interfaces between research fields and between research and economy/society. This has called in particular for renewed efforts to properly evaluate multidisciplinary research and industry-science relationships.  Technical maturity and higher political acceptance. Evaluation methodologies and tools have reached some maturity. Policymakers have growing confidence in evaluation and they use its results more and more in resource allocation and system shaping decisions. international experience, under which conditions evaluation can best contribute to improve the efficiency of public spending on Research and Development. This is challenging since evaluation is not only a technical but also a social process, involving the use of multiple tools to disentangle a complex web of causal relationships at different levels of the research system. In this context this paper reviews the different approaches to evaluation, including its methodology, institutional setting and links to policy making. It is structured according to the object of evaluation distinguishing between four levels: i) Institutes and groups which constitute the basic units of production in the research sector and can be research groups, departments, teams or laboratories; ii) Institutions and operators, such as the large research performing institutions and funding agencies or research councils; iii) Programmes and procedures, including public interventions focused on a single issue or theme and managed by a dedicated entity, as well as measures which address a specific constituency in a generic way without targeting specific problems, topics or sectors; and iv) Systems consisting of whole or subsets (e.g. public policies) of research and/or innovation systems.	funded research *** funded research *** research programmes *** research investments *** research system *** policy instruments *** funded research *** industry-science relationships *** resource allocation *** research system *** funding agencies *** research performance *** innovation systems *** funded research	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)5	RESEARCH USE OF PATENTED INVENTIONS: SUMMARY OF RESPONSES TO THE OECD QUESTIONNAIRE	2006	R	As patenting increases and public research organisations become more actively engaged in commercialising research results, policy makers are faced with the delicate task of designing intellectual property regimes that protecting inventors rights while simultaneously facilitate research use of patented inventions for appropriate purposes. Concerns have risen in many quarters about increasing infringement threats and restraints from research in areas crowded with patents because of concerns over patent infringement. To date, little information exists with which to gauge these concerns or to develop effective policy instruments for addressing them. At their meeting in January 2004, Ministers responsible for chabadi chabado invited the OECD to examine national policies regarding exemptions for research use of patented inventions. As part of this effort, the OECD developed a questionnaire that was distributed to national experts with the aim of shedding light on the scope of research exemptions across OECD countries and gaining insight on other legal provisions that facilitate access for researchers to patented inventions and the knowledge embedded in them. This document summarises responses received from national experts from France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Australia to the questionnaire on national legislation, jurisprudence and practices on research use of patented knowledge. It is divided into four sections: i) a summary of national debates regarding research use; ii) available evidence of impediments to research use or of changed research behaviour because of patenting concerns; iii) a review of research exemptions as codified in national legislation or practiced in jurisprudence; and iv) an examination of alternative provisions to facilitate research access. The debate over research access Survey responses indicate that existing concerns tend to be limited to particular areas, mainly related to life sciences (e.g. patents for gene sequences, exemptions to undertake clinical trials for the development of generic drugs) and public research organisations (e.g. freedom of research, access to third party patents). Some governments have initiated consultations, reforms or commissioned studies to look into the issue of research use of patented knowledge in the past few years (mainly regarding genetic inventions), including Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Australia. Empirical studies Information on research use of patented inventions is scarce and difficult to quantify. Responses to the questionnaire confirmed that there is little hard evidence on the effect of patents on scientific research in general, or on the impact of the research exemption in particular. Surveys in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries undertaken in Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Australia have revealed that concerns are mainly related to patents for DNA sequences and methods for genetic testing in these industries. According to the surveys, there is some evidence of cases of patents leading researchers to refrain from undertaking further research in related areas in Switzerland and Germany, and the general perception among UK respondents is that the scope of research exemptions is unclear. Patent litigation Few countries have information available on patent litigation trends. When such information has been collected, no common trend is found across countries. Patent litigation seems to have grown in recent years   in Japan, whereas Switzerland and Australia have registered little patent litigation and no increasing trends. In contrast, the number of opposition procedures and hearings at patent offices seems to have grown in many jurisdictions. Research exemptions Research exemptions are either statutory or non-statutory and their scope varies across countries. Non-statutory research exemptions depend on case law and their scope may vary over time. In some countries, like Switzerland and Australia, there is neither a statutory exemption, not the matter has been tested in court so far. A statutory research exemption has been recently proposed in Switzerland, though. Statutory research exemptions generally apply to experiments on the subject matter of the patent (and not with the subject matter of the patent). Different interpretation of statutory exemptions by courts across countries and recent reforms in the patent laws of some OECD countries have introduced some diversity among statutory exemptions. For instance, following a change in the patent law in 2005, the research exemption in Belgium allows acts done with scientific objectives on and/or with the subject matter of the patented invention. Provisions to facilitate access In general, no comprehensive government-led initiatives were identified by respondents to the questionnaire. An example of a cross-country initiative, limited to a specific field, is the OECD Best Practice Guidelines for Licensing Genomic Inventions, adopted by OECD countries in February 2006. As regards possible future initiatives, Japan is currently considering the preparation of a 'guideline for licensing INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT derived from publicly funded Research and Development for the purpose of research use'. Given the increasing trend to encourage patenting of research results some PROs have started to release guidelines for the commercialisation of research results, and their technology transfer offices take care of facilitating access to them, among other things favouring the grant of non-exclusive licenses. Within the private sector, except for a few isolated examples, firms do not tend to have general schemes facilitating access to their inventions for researchers. As regards collective initiatives from the private sector, the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association issued a recommendation in January 2006 concerning licensing of research tools.	intellectual property *** research organisations *** patented inventions *** research results *** research use *** policy instruments *** patented inventions *** research use *** research exemptions *** patented inventions *** patented knowledge *** research use *** research exemptions *** research use *** research organisations *** patented knowledge *** research use *** patented inventions *** research use *** research exemptions *** scientific research *** research exemptions *** research exemptions *** research exemptions *** research exemptions *** research exemptions *** patent law *** research exemptions *** patent law *** patented inventions *** best practices *** funded research *** intellectual property *** research use *** commercialisation of research *** technology transfer *** research results *** private sector *** private sector *** research tools *** patented inventions *** research use	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)6	GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY - PROJECT PROPOSAL	2006	S	PART A background. Over the past decade the intensity and multiplicity of trans-border economic transactions have accelerated. With this globalisation a more competitive global economy unfolds. In this changing environment business strategies are being reformulated. Some interesting trends appear to be: (i) Firms are turning to a more open model of innovation that makes more extensive use of research results that originate from outside their firms' boundaries, whether in the public or private sectors. (2)Innovation is being democratized, which means that users of products and services-both  firms and individual consumers-are increasingly able to innovate for themselves. (3) Increasing globalisation of Research and Development (esp. of multinational  firms),  industry  structure  and  value chains. Open innovation is extending across national boundaries, Research and Development is becoming more footloose, industry-science relationships are globalizing, and new global players are emerging, challenging OECD economies to remain competitive. (iv) Business Research and Development is increasingly linked to business strategy. Business Research and Development investments are no   longer made in a support role that is only indirectly linked to business objectives, but are driven by increasingly linked to the development of new products, processes, and services, and firms actively seek to demonstrate financial returns on their Research and Development investments. PARTB Objectives. This project aims to identify how globalization changed companies' business strategies (e.g. organization of Research and Development, strategic alliances and localization decisions on Research and Development) and what can be learned from that for policy. The project will help explain the changing nature of innovation (within manufacturing and services) and its strategic importance to OECD countries. And it should lead to a sounder basis for policies to strengthen growth, employment and productivity in OECD countries in a context of increased outsourcing and globalization. More specific aims of the project are: Develop greater insight into relevant trends on globalisation and changing business strategies and their interactions. Identify via case studies of firms or sectors how industry is coping with the challenges it faces in a globalizing economy.  Address - and if possible develop a new conceptual map of - the main policy issues (many interconnected) that policymakers will likely need to engage and resolve in maintaining national progress along acceptable growth paths. Issues for national government policies are e.g.: Trade offs between cooperation and competition. Trade offs between global, national and local policies: what government support is the most effective at what level. Approaches to determining levels of domestic public support for Research and Development where the linkages are increasingly global and the prospects for benefits lie beyond the domestic boundary. How best to react to the new global pressures on domestic labour markets and outsourcing: the dilemma of  hybrid firm boundaries versus inflexible labour market regulation. Whether the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT principles well facilitate tech transfer or impede innovation because of the risk of over-patenting that leads to 'tragedy of the anticommons'. Implications of a globalizing economy for the state-aid framework (WTO, EU). Acquisition of external technology (licensing, corporate VC, collaborative research) and or externalisation of Research and Development results (licensing, spin offs). Measures to raise public awareness and acceptance of new technologies and innovation. Location factors for businesses.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)8	ACTIVITIES report to CSTP	2006	M	Thematic activities of the TIP recently completed or on-going : (1) Evaluation of innovation policies (The TIP project on behavioural additionality of public support to business Research and Development has been completed. The TIP is ready to contribute to the CSTP's 2007-2008 work programme, notably work on the evaluation of global research networks.). (2) PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for innovation (TIP engaged in a series of peer reviews of country experiences with Public Private Partnerships for research and innovation. The project will draw to a conclusion in 2006 with the publication of a final report drawing key lessons). (3) lntellectual property rights and innovation (a conference was co-organised in Berlin in June 2005 by the OECD, European Patent Office and German Ministry of Industry and Labour that examined the valuation and exploitation of patents and included discussions of licensing practices in a range of industries, work is on-going and aims to identify effective approaches for ensuring that research is not unnecessarily impeded by the increased patenting of inventions in the public and private sectors).  (4) Tax incentives for innovation (the TIP thematic workshop on Fiscal Incentives for Research and Development in June 2005 ; a further Working Paper compares tax regimes across most OECD countries and presents an index of the relative generosity of tax systems to these investments, similar to the B-index for Research and Development tax incentives). (5) Globalisation of Research and Development and Open lnnovation (focused on documenting current trends in globalisation through a country questionnaire. A complete summary was discussed by the TIP in December 2005 ; In August 2006 the TIP launched a follow-on activity on Globalisation and Open Innovation under the 2007-2008 work programme).  (6) Assessment of national science and innovation policies (with Country case studies on Policy mixes for innovation : It will produce a series of country-specific reports summarising the results of the peer reviews, as well as a synthesis report that  draws key lessons that can be applied by other countries). The 5 Future Orientations for the 2007-2008 Biennium are  (1) Globalisation and Open innovation. (2) Evaluation of innovation policy. (3) Intellectual property rights. And (4) Sectoral innovation, and (5) Geographical location of innovative activity. The TIP could contribute to the CSTP work on innovation in health and possibly nanotechnology. The TIP's expertise on sectoral innovation, including the analysis of policies to foster innovation and the commercialisation of public research results could  be of relevance.	behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** peer review *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** intellectual property *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** globalisation of research *** globalisation and open innovation *** policy mix *** peer review *** globalisation and open innovation *** intellectual property *** innovation activities *** public research results	other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research

DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)10	SUMMARY OF THE HAGUE CONFERENCE ON GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION	2007	W2	On 6 December 2006 the OECD and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted a one day conference on Globalisation and Open Innovation that brought together academic experts, technology managers and business representatives, and policy makers to consider the policy implications of the acceleration in the globalisation of research and innovation and the shift towards open innovation strategies in companies. The discussion centred around three main topics: - i) the rise of open innovation and open business models in the context of globalisation ii) the evidence for open innovation, drawing mainly on company case studies; and iii) the implications for science, technology and innovation policies. The policy roundtable focused on the latter. Dirk Pilat, Head of the OECD's chabadi chabado introduced some of the policy issues underlying the discussion on open innovation and globalisation. To expand technological opportunities companies must access competencies wherever they lie (i.e. locally or globally). Footloose companies raise the challenge of ensuring returns from public support at home (e.g. through spill-overs). The key policy challenge that emerged from the discussion on globalisation and open innovation was how to foster innovation in a changing business environment, one characterised by a shorter time-to-market, shorter product life-cycles and the erosion of dominant positions. The questions to panellists then centred on what are the barriers to open innovation and what governments could do, if anything, to address them? How can governments help strengthen the science base, including human resource development? Should governments adjust their support to business Research and Development and innovation in light of open innovation? How can governments facilitate the democratisation of innovation (and what are the implications for INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT policies)? Finally, will improving the relative attractiveness of countries for innovation (e.g. by improving the business environment) help countries to capture greater economic spill-overs from innovation? Panellists at the Policy Roundtable, chaired by Ms. Ann Mettler of the Lisbon Council, were invited to discuss the policy issues and respond to questions from participants. A key question raised by several participants was whether open innovation was in fact new or, to paraphrase one speaker, whether it was old wine in new bottles? Panellists agreed that while co-operation has always existed, the phenomenon  has  grown in importance. Large  businesses are  now  globally distributed which  makes  the vertical model for Research and Development and innovation obsolete. There is also greater awareness that no firm or research institute has all the knowledge and that feedback from the market, including users, is necessary to respond to it. Another new aspect of open innovation is that co-operation between business and the academic community is characterised more by the sharing of knowledge than by technology transfer as it was in the recent past. The tendency for firms (and more recently for universities) to patent everything is not the optimal way to create new knowledge and to generate value.  Several main areas of policy action emerged from the discussion between panellists and participants. (i) Getting framework conditions right. There was broad consensus that it was important to get the framework conditions for the business environment and public research right. At the same time, participants agreed that the role of government policy should not be over-estimated. In addition, country differences may require different areas of focus and the case studies present an opportunity to learn from the experience of OECD countries. (ii) Adapting research and innovation policies. Participants called for changes in the way universities and public research organisations are evaluated and the way research is rewarded so as to promote greater impact (quality) rather than production (quantity). As regards innovation policies, speakers and panellists noted that specific firms should not be targeted but rather that networks and eco- systems of firms should be the focus. Current policies to support innovation (e.g. tax incentives) focus on creating incentives for firms to build in-house Research and Development and innovation capacity rather than on network building. In addition, instruments in many countries do not cover service-oriented  firms with little in-house Research and Development capacity that depend on networks to innovate. It was also felt that there was a need to create more awareness and capacity in chabadu chabados regarding the importance of open innovation strategies. (iii) Balancing INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT and knowledge sharing. IP policies were considered by most participants to remain important but governments should ensure that rights are clearly defined so that firms can understand the risks of infringements as well as the opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing. Some participants viewed IP policies, especially in universities (e.g. Bayh-Dole types of legislation) as counter productive in an open innovation context. Innovation sometimes requires letting go of IP but it is up to owners to determine when and where not to hold on to IP. A possible role for government is supporting the capacity for knowledge sharing (e.g. through open source platforms, intellectual commons). (iv) Building trust. Related to knowledge sharing, participants stressed the role of trust in co-operation and in open innovation. Within firms and research institutions, organisational changes as well as the creation of forums and open space areas can foster communication and build relational capital. Well functioning legal and regulatory environments can also help shape the norms for trust building. (v) Develop talent and encourage mobility. Knowledge is partly embodied in people and participants felt that training, especially for managing research collaborations, was important as was mobility  of research personnel. (vi) Promoting networking. Networking is central to open innovation. However, - participants in particular from industry - were divided as to what governments could do. Information gaps in networks were also considered a challenge, especially for chabadu chabados. Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) were viewed as important catalysts for co-operation and networks. (vii) Growing new technology based firms. NTBFs play a key role in open innovation strategies of large firms so support to entrepreneurship and new firm creation was considered important, especially  by addressing financing issues. Theo Roelandt, Chairman of the TIP stressed that globalisation and open innovation are two sides of the same coin. Policy he said focuses on three areas: creating talent; promoting research and technology development; and building trust, which is especially important for entrepreneurship. It is a shared responsibility between the public and private sectors. In an open society, open boundaries and open innovation go hand in hand. Achieving this will require changes to way the universities work as well as greater openness towards knowledge migrants. The hope is that open innovation strategies will allow more players and countries to take part in the knowledge economy and benefit more from globalisation.	open innovation *** globalisation of research *** globalisation and open innovation *** business models *** open innovation *** globalisation and open innovation *** business environment *** globalisation and open innovation *** open innovation *** human resources *** science base *** business research and development *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** business environment *** open innovation *** research organisations *** open innovation *** technology transfer *** new knowledge *** framework conditions *** business environment *** public research *** framework conditions *** research organisations *** support innovation *** innovation capacity *** tax incentives *** small and medium sized firms *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** open innovation *** research organisations *** collaborative research *** open innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** public private partnerships *** new technologies *** technology based firms *** open innovation *** globalisation and open innovation *** technology development *** private sector *** open innovation *** open innovation *** knowledge economy *** globalisation and open innovation	internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)11	PROPOSAL FOR A WORKSHOP ON TAX SCHEMES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS Research and Development	2007	S	Tax incentives have become an important instrument in the field of public innovation policies. Many countries have adopted them as general tools which, unlike subsidies, can improve the national Research and Development spending environment without targeting specific sectors or technologies. To the traditional challenge of encouraging research in order to strengthen companies' competitiveness must now be added that  of ensuring a country's attractiveness for Research and Development activities. Most countries of the European Union (but not Germany) have a tax instrument to encourage companies to increase their Research and Development expenditures. Various non- European countries also have tax schemes to promote Research and Development (United States, Japan, China, South Korea, Canada, Australia). Depending on the country, tax reduction or credit calculations are based on the volume of Research and Development expenditures, the increment in Research and Development spending or a combination of both. Since 2004, France has used a dual system, as do Australia, Austria, Ireland, Korea, Portugal and Spain. The indicator calculated by the OECD to establish international comparisons ranks France among the countries in which the system is most favourable. This standing may have shifted in the past couple of years insofar as some countries have been changing their systems. The development of these instruments makes international comparisons more necessary, not only to measure their incentive value but also to assess their respective effectiveness and identify best practices. Proposed topics for the workshop (1) Qualitative and quantitative comparison of schemes: Measurement of the extent to which the tax relief lowers costs, Which companies are helped most, depending on how the measure is designed  (differentiation by size, ceiling, limits on certain expenditures, etc.), Inclusion of tax incentives in the overall Research and Development support system, Cost of managing schemes, both for government and for companies. (2) Evaluation of the effectiveness of schemes: Survey of past and ongoing evaluations and methods used in selected countries, whether these evaluate the quantitative impact on business Research and Development (leverage effect) or changes in companies' behaviour vis--vis the types of projects or partnerships (behavioural additionality); Methods for taking into account interactions with other forms of business Research and Development assistance, such as subsidies; Results, main lessons learned, best practices; analysis being conducted in selected countries and plans for changing systems (The issues of attractiveness and the risk of tax dumping might be addressed).	tax incentives *** research and development activities *** research and development expenditures *** research and development expenditures *** best practices *** supporting research and development *** tax incentives *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** best practices *** business research and development	policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)13	PEER REVIEW: ITS USES, DEMANDS, AND ISSUES	2007	R	1. The aim of the OECD workshop on Rethinking Evaluation in Science and Technology, to be held at the French Research Ministry on 29-30 October 2007, is to foster an open discussion between experts and policy makers on two issues that dominate the discussion on the evaluation of research and innovation policies, namely the role and relevance of peer review as an objective tool for evaluation and the issue of the use of evaluations in setting priorities/decision making in research and innovation policies (e.g. determining what public research to fund or whether to allocate public support to business innovation via direct or indirect means). 2. The 2-day workshop, organised under the auspices of two CSTP working parties, the TIP (Technology and Innovation Policy) and the SFRI (Steering and Funding of Research Institutions), will attempt to:  Summarise the problems associated with peer review and priority setting.  Analyse approaches and solutions to these problems.  Identify good practices for peer review and priority setting.  Provide practical solutions for policy makers. 3. The workshop is part of a larger CSTP project on evaluation whose aim is to help policy makers to develop a better understanding of the issues to be considered in designing and implementing the evaluation of research and innovation policies. The project is expected to produce a set of reports covering good practices and recommendations for improving the evaluation of research and innovation policies.	evaluation tools *** evaluation of research *** peer review *** priority setting *** public research *** business innovation *** research organisations *** peer review *** priority setting *** good practices *** peer review *** priority setting *** evaluation of research *** good practices *** evaluation of research *** peer review	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)14	Summary of the TIP Workshop on Rethinking Evaluation in Science and Technology	2007	W2	The evaluation of public policy is a constant and characteristic phenomenon of modern knowledge-based economies. Evaluations are useful for designing, monitoring, assessing the effectiveness and legitimising public policy interventions. The area of science and technology is not exempt from this public scrutiny and accountability given the amounts of public spending devoted to Research and Development and innovation. In many ways, evaluation is an integral part of a country's national innovation system insofar as it is both a tool for policy making but also a process for policy learning and development. The way evaluation is used and institutionalised in chabadi chabado making, however, varies greatly across OECD countries. In some countries, evaluation is the remit of technical experts and limited to discrete policy interventions. In others, evaluation is used more systemically at different levels of policy making and by different institutions and actors (e.g. funding agencies, PROs, ministries). In light of the growing focus on evaluation in the Science and Technology field in many OECD countries, the CSTP has requested its Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) to help countries develop a better understanding of the issues in designing and implementing their own evaluation practices and methods. The TIP has therefore proceeded to organise a project on evaluation of research and innovation policies looking at four main areas: 1) the role of peer review as a tool in the evaluation of research and innovation policies, programmes and institutions; 2) the role of evaluation in priority setting and decision making; 3) the role of the internationalisation of evaluation; and 4) the architecture or systems of  evaluation in countries (see DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)15). The CSTP's working group on Steering and Funding of Research Institutions (SFRI), is working with the TIP on this project by focusing on the evaluation of public research organisations (PROs). This paper presents a summary of the discussion of two expert workshops held jointly by TIP and SFRI on 29-30 October at the French Research Ministry. These workshops focused on Peer Review and Priority Setting, respectively. The most salient points that emerged from the discussions and presentations are outlined below and further details are provided in the attached summary report of the two expert workshops. (i) On the problems faced by peer review as a tool for ex ante and ex post evaluations the following points emerged: Despite problems in peer review including a hollowing out due to time constraints and rising financial costs, and the risk of conflicts of interest among peer reviewers, the peer review process remains a fundamental mechanism for all stages of research planning and implementation; and for both ex ante project selection and ex post evaluation. Solutions are available to improve peer review, including by making the process more transparent, by providing clear objectives and guidelines to reviewers and by using different tools (e g extended peer review processes involving non-scientific stakeholders) and a variety of metrics and indicators. However, while indicators can strengthen and inform judgements, they are not a form of judgement in themselves Making judgement still requires careful consideration to prevent perverse outcomes. There is a need to facilitate and improve the internationalisation of peer review because of increased international collaboration However, caution is needed when policy is transferred across different cultures and contexts, particularly when understandings of policies are incomplete Therefore, there is a need for a taxonomy of the internationalisation of peer  review  Such a taxonomy could be developed by OECD. Finally, one size does not fit all and hence a much better understanding of the design requirements for peer review is needed. (ii) On evaluation and its use for priority setting and policy making the following points emerged from the workshop: Although priority setting and evaluation interact in policy making, they remain two distinct dimensions of policy making with their own characteristics and internal processes. ln line with the increase in actors in chabadi chabado making (e g regional governments, separate funding agencies, etc ) priority setting has become more complex and now involves more actors using different approaches and methodologies This increases the need for mechanisms that can ensure greater coherence between priority setting and policy making. Despite the emergence of new quantitative tools for evaluation, the conceptual underpinning of priority setting remains rather weak and expert opinion continues to predominate in the types of evaluation used by policy makers to make policy decisions. lmproving the process of priority setting through the use of ex ante evaluations requires political buy-in from the different stakeholders and commitment to invest in resources and develop skills as well as the creation of indicators and data to monitor policy or programme effectiveness. The process of priority setting in Science and Technology could itself be the subject of evaluation in order to identify structural weaknesses as well as best practices. The interest of the international community and of the OECD in particular, is essential to improve the ability of countries to effectively develop and foster the use ex ante evaluation in priority setting and policy making in general.	knowledge-based economy *** policy interventions *** policy processes *** policy profiles *** national innovation systems *** policy interventions *** funding agencies *** peer review *** evaluation tools *** evaluation of research *** priority setting *** research organisations *** research organisations *** peer review *** priority setting *** peer review *** peer review *** peer review *** international collaboration *** peer review *** priority setting *** funding agencies *** priority setting *** evaluation tools *** priority setting *** priority setting *** best practices *** priority setting *** priority setting	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes

DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)16	STI Outlook 2008 - Draft Chapter 1: Main Trends in Science and Innovation	2007	O	The evidence discussed here suggests that performance in science, technology and innovation has continued to strengthen in recent years, in OECD and related economies. Against the background of continued diversity within the OECD, there are a number of major trends in play. The absolute growth of Research and Development and innovation-related activities is leading to continued growth of the HRST labour force, and to greater international mobility of researchers and highly-skilled people. Continued rapid growth in China has been accompanied by dramatic growth in Research and Development and Research and Development employment there, while future targets for Chinese Research and Development intensity imply that this growth will continue. However China is only part of the story of transition across the developing world - the rise of the BRICS economies in scientific and technological fields is a widespread phenomenon and countries such as Turkey and Mexico are all advancing. This suggests shifts in the composition of world science and technology activity. Alongside this trend is continued globalisation in Research and Development, which also appears to be changing its character, towards worldwide sourcing of technological capabilities. Taken together, the evidence suggests major transitions in the world economy in years ahead.	international mobility *** research and development intensity *** technology fields *** globalisation of research	policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)17	Chapter 2 of the STI Outlook 2008 - Main Trends in Science, Technology and Innovation Policies	2007	O	As the first draft of this chapter indicates, OECD countries continue to reform their science and technology policies to improve the efficiency of their national innovation systems in response to common changes in the global environment but also in response to newly elected governments, societal demands to address global challenges or to self-initiated reforms and evaluations, including in the context of international peer reviews. The differences in terms of economic development and Science and Technology capacity and innovation performance in countries suggest that there will be differences in the prioritisation of challenges and opportunities but also in the targeting of policy responses. As some advanced OECD countries have experienced a drop in business Research and Development spending, attracting and stimulating Research and Development investment becomes a clear priority. For catching-up economies in the EU, participation in the European Research Area and the use of structural and regional funds to boost domestic capacity for research and innovation will be a major challenge in the coming years. For catching up economies outside the OECD, the key challenge ahead remains building the infrastructure, both institutional, physical and intellectual, in order to use Science and Technology and Innovation as a source of future economic growth. The brief survey of country experience and trends in Science and Technology and Innovation policies provide useful lessons and insights for designing and implementing policies.	global challenges *** national innovation systems *** peer review *** countrys innovation performance *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** economic growth	policy_area_global_challenges *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)18	ASSESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF PUBLIC Research and Development	2007	R	Assessing the impacts of public Research and Development on society and the economy has become a central concern of policy makers for several reasons. First, understanding and measuring the impacts of public Research and Development is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of public investments and their contribution to the socio-economic goals of a country. Second, it enhances public accountability, creates a better informed society and diffuses and raises awareness of the contribution of public research to the economic and social development of a country. Although assessing the impacts of public Research and Development is not an easy task and poses some methodological challenges, a number of new approaches and analytical techniques have emerged over the past years, which have enabled a better understanding of the methods, the results and their respective strengths and weaknesses for policy making. This review presents a selection of some of the most promising and forward looking practices that have been recently carried out by a number of OECD countries. The review is part of the TIP's contribution to CSTP's activity on Enhancing the Contribution of Science and Innovation to Economic Growth and is closely linked to the CSTP work on evaluation. The activity also follows up on the 2006 Global Science Forum workshop on the Science of Science Policy. The review finds that by and large the current efforts to assess the impacts of public Research and Development fail to capture the full range of impacts that public Research and Development has on society. It also finds that the techniques used are still evolving. Moreover, the choice of a specific analytical technique to assess public Research and Development impacts is not random but rather context specific. The timing and objective of the assessment as well as the nature and scope of the public Research and Development funded are factors that must be born in mind when selecting an analytical technique from an existing tool-kit. Furthermore, while a variety of methodologies can be recommended to assess socio-economic impacts, tools for assessing the non-economic impacts accruing from public Research and Development remain weak. This being said, progress can be made, notably by using a variety of techniques, aggregate, micro- economic and case studies to provide evidence on the impacts of public investments in Research and Development. The use of each technique will depend on the type of research being funded, its main objectives and the degree to which outcomes can be measured in economic or non-economic terms. While such a broad approach is unlikely to lead to internationally comparable results and benchmarks as regards the impacts of public Research and Development, it can lead to improved evidence on many of the outcomes of public investment in Research and Development. International cooperation may need to be deepened in order to accelerate the development of more comparable impact indicators and analytical techniques. The OECD provides a platform to make progress towards improving analytical techniques and the cross-country comparability of impact assessments. The OECD has a long track record in developing state of the art of internationally comparable indicators in the area of Research and Development and innovation. In addition, current NESTI work on impact indicators could benefit from complementary work by the TIP to identify good practices from an international comparison of methodological frameworks and practices for impact assessment. Finally, it remains crucial to recognise that some important values of scientific research will remain hard to quantify. Investment in some areas of basic science is primarily made to satisfy human curiosity and deepen our understanding of the universe. In some cases, such research may prove to have benefits beyond pure knowledge and the satisfaction of curiosity; in other cases, it may not	impacts of public research *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** public investment in research *** public research *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** economic growth *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** public research and development *** public research and development *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** socio-economic impacts *** public investment in research *** public investment in research *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** impact assessment *** good practices *** impact assessment *** scientific research *** impacts of public research *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** socio-economic impacts	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)19	GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION Draft report on globalisation and open innovation	2007	R	211. Globalisation implies that innovation has become crucial for the competitiveness of OECD countries. At the same time it increasingly affects how companies within OECD countries innovate. Companies increasingly innovate and undertake Research and Development activities on a global scale abroad as they source technology internationally and tap into worldwide centres of knowledge. Previously, technological capabilities abroad were largely aimed at adapting products and services to the needs of host countries and were undertaken in order to support local manufacturing operations of the MNE. 212. A second major trend in business innovation strategies is that companies are becoming increasingly open in their innovation process, not only in industries like ICT and pharmaceuticals/biotechnology, but increasingly also in other industries. Companies 'openly' innovate with customers, suppliers, competitors, universities and research institutes, etc. as they increasingly rely on outside innovation for new products and processes. Consequently increased Research and Development cooperation is becoming an important way of knowledge sourcing in order to generate new ideas and bring them quickly to the market. 213. Although these trends towards increasing globalisation of Research and Development/innovation and more open innovation are not totally new, they take place at a much faster pace today. Because of growing intense and global competition, product life cycles have shortened drastically. At the same time, the growing integration of different technologies has resulted in an increasing multidisciplinarity and complexity of technology making innovation more costly and more risky. These factors force companies to innovate more quickly and more efficiently, and as such companies increasingly look for partners with complementary expertise in order to get quick access to different technologies. 214. The emergence of global value chains increasingly spreads out also to innovation activities resulting in the development of innovation networks or so-called ecosystems across the world. The innovation process becomes increasingly fragmented not only geographically but also 'institutionally' through the cooperation with external partners. Large multinational enterprises (MNEs) are the main drivers in this process as MNEs headquarters increasingly innovate together with their affiliates abroad within their multinational networks. The Research and Development facilities abroad of MNEs are embedded in the national/regional innovation systems of host countries and have access to local knowledge bases. Globalisation broadens the choice of external innovation partners and leverages open innovation on a global scale: Research and Development subsidiaries abroad increasingly serve as the nodes within the MNEs ecosystems. 215. These trends in innovation differ between industries and companies since the attractiveness of international and open innovation directly depends on the size of the company, the life cycle of the products and services offered by the company and the industry in which the company is active. Opportunity conditions ('how easy is it to innovate, radically or incrementally?'), appropriability conditions ('how easy is it to protect innovation?'), cumulativeness ('to what degree are innovations of today the basis for innovations of tomorrow?') and the degree of multidisciplinarity and cross-functional complexity of knowledge all directly determine the potential open innovation on a global scale. The empirical evidence based on the case studies and large scale data clearly show that important differences exist in open innovation practices between industries and companies. 216. Different modes are used by companies to source external knowledge (i.e. the outside-in or inbound side of open innovation): partnerships with external parties (alliances, joint ventures, joint development.) and acquiring/selling knowledge (contract Research and Development, purchasing, licensing.). While these modes are more common practices, open innovation has been increasingly realized through corporate   venturing (equity investments in university spin-offs or in venture capital investment funds). Venture investing was until recently almost exclusively done by specialized venture capital funds, but large companies have started to use this technique to create a window on new technology developments and to market more quickly and efficiently innovations that are not directly related to their core competencies (i.e. spinning-in). 217. Venturing has become especially important for the so-called inside-out or outbound side of open innovation, as companies increasingly look for external partners for commercialisation of their innovations that are not used internally. Divesting internally-developed technologies through spinning out or spinning off is typically done in order to offer the project better chances of success away from corporate influence. Another alternative that is becoming more prominent is licensing-out to external partners who can use the technology in exchange for paying royalty fees. Empirical data show that so-called technology markets are growing as patents are increasingly licensed out by companies. 218. Open innovation on a global scale necessitates the implementation of an open business model through which the innovation/Research and Development strategy is explicitly incorporated in the overall business strategy. The open character of innovation calls for special attention to the issue of intellectual property rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT) within the business model. Traditionally INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management has been relatively closed with patenting done because of defensive and strategic reasons, but increasingly companies acknowledge that INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management may also generate additional revenues (for technologies and innovations that are not used in house). 219. The company case studies clearly show the diversity of open innovation by illustrating the use of the different modes in accessing and valuing external knowledge by companies. Examples of technology alliances, spinning-in, venture capital funds, the use of internet and intranet, show the importance of knowledge sourcing for innovation. The information in the case studies also shows how open innovation is closely linked with other functional domains within companies like e.g. human resources management and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management. 220. The evidence of the case studies also suggests that openness depends on the phases in the innovation process and the structural characteristics of the industry. Companies are found to be relatively more open in the 'exploration' phase of innovation during which they actively search for new knowledge and technology. The innovation process becomes less open the more the company approaches the 'exploitation' phase, i.e. towards the commercialisation of the innovation. The speed of this closing down seems to be related to the knowledge conditions of the industry: the shorter the technology life cycle and the stronger the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT protection, the more companies can accommodate openness in their innovation process. 221. In addition to the case studies, the report presented also several new empirical indicators to assess the importance an evolution of open innovation on a global scale. Until now, empirical evidence based on large scale data that were comparable across industries and countries has been lacking. Overall, these indicators based on Research and Development data, innovation surveys, patent data and data on licensing show that companies increasingly innovate together with external and international partners. Companies were found to collaborate in innovation especially with suppliers and customers, while cooperation with universities and research institutions was found to be less important. 222. While open innovation is on the rise in most countries and most industries, the data show clearly that larger firms innovate more openly than chabadu chabados. Notwithstanding chabadu chabados may be expected to be more open in innovation because of their limited resources. These results therefore suggest that limited resources may prevent chabadu chabados to deploy open innovation practices more broadly, and on an international scale.   223. The empirical data also shows that despite globalisation, geographic proximity still matters in open innovation. Companies were found to collaborate more with geographically close external partners, although it should be taken into account that the data measure only the number of interactions and not the intensity and quality of collaboration. 224. Globalisation and the emergence of open innovation have several implications for science, technology and innovation policies. Firstly framework conditions (i.e. well-functioning product and labour markets, venture capital, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and competition policies, a strong public research base, etc) may be the most important policy lever for countries. At the same time, because open innovation involves innovating outside firm and national boundaries, it is becoming clear that policies cannot be designed solely in context of geographically bound knowledge-based activities or in the context of vertically integrated value chains of firms. For example, policies to promote (national) networking/clusters may have to be adapted to take into account the globalization of Research and Development and production networks. Discrete measures to promote in-house Research and Development and innovation may no longer be sufficient as in the past if firms are in-sourcing or outsourcing their Research and Development and innovation processes (e.g. through corporate venturing strategies). Policies to foster greater industry-science relations will also be affected by the cross-border linkages of public research institutions and firms. Policy responses appear to be gradually aligning themselves with the challenges posed by open innovation and globalisation. However, there remain several gaps including the need for a coherent cross- government approach; the need to better encourage the internationalisation of science-industry relations, including between public research organisations and involving smaller firms.	research and development activities *** host country *** innovation process *** business innovation *** research organisations *** new products *** globalisation of research *** open innovation *** life cycle *** global value chains *** innovation activities *** innovation process *** knowledge base *** host country *** innovation systems *** open innovation *** life cycle *** open innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation *** joint ventures *** open innovation *** contract research *** venture capital *** open innovation *** venture capital *** new technologies *** open innovation *** technology markets *** development strategies *** business models *** business strategies *** open innovation *** business models *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** venture capital *** open innovation *** human resources *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** innovation process *** new knowledge *** technological knowledge *** innovation process *** innovation process *** life cycle *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** research organisations *** small and medium sized firms *** open innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** open innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation *** framework conditions *** venture capital *** research base *** public research *** competition policy *** labour market *** intellectual property *** value chains *** open innovation *** innovation process *** research organisations *** globalisation and open innovation *** research organisations *** globalisation and open innovation	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)2	GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION Module 1: Draft report on trends and factors in open innovation	2007	R	1. At the TIP meeting in June 2006, a proposal was approved for the project 'Globalisation and Open Innovation' (DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)6). The project aims to identify how globalization changes companies' business strategies of which open innovation and what can be learned from that for policy. The overall objective is to identify best practice business strategies to successfully adapt innovation strategies to globalisation/internationalization and to analyze what role open innovation plays in this. As such it should provide a sounder basis for policies to strengthen growth, employment and productivity in a context of increased outsourcing and globalisation. 2. The project is organised around three modules: 1) Desk research on globalisation and open innovation: literature review on trends, factors, determinants of both phenomena of globalisation and open innovation; as much as possible supported by empirical evidence; 2) Case studies on firm level and sector level: case studies in different countries in order to analyze how open innovation may be an answer to globalisation, based on a standardized questionnaire; 3) Policy implications and recommendations: analyzing tensions and new policy issues of 'national' government policies in a more globalised and open innovation environment. 3. In total 13 countries have agreed to participate in this project: 4 lead countries (Belgium, Japan, Netherlands and Norway) contributing to the overall coordination of the project and to the case study work, and 8 other countries (Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) who have agreed to undertake case studies. Very recently, Germany also proposed to participate in the case study work. 4. The project is explicitly linked with the on-going work on the globalisation of Research and Development/Innovation within CSTP and TIP, since the results of that work will directly feed in the final report of the 'Globalisation and Open Innovation' project. The document 'Internationalisation of business research' (DSTI/STP/TIP(2006)11) was discussed during the TIP-meeting of December 2006 and examined the progress since the CSTP Forum on the Internationalisation of Research and Development in understanding both the drivers and motivations for the internationalisation of business research, as well as the policy implications. In order to prevent duplication of work, the activities undertaken thus far in the project 'Globalisation and Open Innovation' have been mostly focused on open innovation, without however neglecting the topic of globalisation in developing the questionnaire and undertaking the case studies. 5. Based on the literature review on globalisation as well as open innovation (module 1), and taking into account the progress and first insights of the case studies (module 2), it is proposed to structure the final report along the following 6 research questions. 1) Trends in the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation; what are the driving factors and determinants; which strategies are implemented by companies; what does the empirical evidence shows? 2) Definition of open innovation: how can open innovation accurately be described as the term is rather broad and has often been used in different meanings in (policy) discussions? 3) Empirical measures of open innovation: how important is open innovation in practice; despite the widespread use of the term and the existence of case studies, ample empirical measures on open innovation have been developed until now.   4) Interdependence of globalisation and open innovation: how do they link, how do they interact, are the same drivers responsible for both phenomena, is the one the answer to the second? 5) Case studies: the diversity of the case studies across countries offers the potential of describing and analyzing open innovation in chabadu chabados and larger firms, in lower and higher tech industries, in manufacturing and services sectors. 6) Policy implications/recommendations: analyzing if and how governments could/should optimally change their (innovation) policies. 6. These research questions are also used to structure this progress document in order to report on some first findings of the desk research, and also to indicate the activities that will be undertaken in the remainder of this project. For the progress report and some first insights of the case study work, we refer to DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)3. The next steps for the policy implications/recommendations will be proposed and discussed in DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)4	globalisation and open innovation *** business strategies *** open innovation *** business strategies *** open innovation *** best practices *** globalisation and open innovation *** globalisation of research *** globalisation and open innovation *** internationalisation of research *** business research and development *** globalisation and open innovation *** open innovation *** globalisation of research *** open innovation *** open innovation *** globalisation and open innovation *** open innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** services sector *** globalisation and open innovation	internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)20/REV1	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN INTERNATIONAL Research and Development COLLABORATION: BACKGROUND AND ISSUES	2007	R	1. At the June 2007 TIP meeting Delegates agreed to undertake follow-up work on the issue of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS in the area of international Research and Development collaboration as a follow-up to previous TIP work on innovation and intellectual property rights. The expertise accumulated over the years and the current policy demands for understanding how IP is managed across global innovation networks presents an opportunity for the TIP to contribute to the broader work on INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs being undertaken in the context of the OECD Innovation Strategy. 2. It was agreed that the focus of the TIP should be limited to identifying barriers and good practice solutions for IP management in international collaborative Research and Development and innovation, including open innovation platforms. A special focus could be given to identifying practical examples of ways to ensure broader access to IP in the context of collaborative projects that aim to meet global challenges. Indeed, in order to promote research and the diffusion of technologies that can address global challenges such as climate change, energy efficiency and security or public health, the space for INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT must be clearly defined. OECD governments play an important role in funding Research and Development in these areas and many programmes are implemented by government institutions or in partnership with the private sector. Traditionally, most of the IP (patents, copyrights, trademarks etc) is granted to the recipient research institutions to a significant degree. As a result, the diffusion of climate-friendly technology would typically be along a pathway of licensing or royalty payments rather than use without restriction in the public domain. IP sharing strategies in such partnerships can influence the flow of such technology directly through their influence on the private sector or public institutes that receive funding from government for their Research and Development. 3. As a result, it was proposed that the TIP work should aim to:  Provide policy makers with an analysis of the evolving role of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT in international Research and Development collaboration between firms but also involving public actors with a view to identify barriers and obstacles.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)3	GLOBALISATION AND OPEN INNOVATION  Module 2: Progress Report on the case studies and results of the expert working meeting of 27 April 2007	2007	R	30. The evidence collected in the case studies undertaken so far seems to suggest that the more distant the technology is from its commercialization, the more companies are using open innovation systems. Outside-in and inside-out strategies are implemented depending on the fact if the explorative technology matches the current business strategy of the company. 31. However, if the company foresees to commercialize the technology in the not distant future, open innovation becomes less attractive as it risks to disseminate the expected market profits with other partner- companies. Only in the case the company lacks the necessary capabilities to effectively commercialize the technology, inside-out practices are set-up in order to gain access to this external knowledge. 32. The evidence also describes the importance of open innovation throughout the life cycle of technology. When the technology is rather new and explorative, companies and other research organizations actively collaborate in order to find the required solutions in the market ('not all smart people work for your company'). Internal and external developed technologies are combined and further developed in-house and/or in (full) cooperation. When the technology evolves further and becomes more exploitative in character, companies are looking for ways to successfully commercialize the technology. If they possess the necessary knowledge and complementary assets, companies will do this with a minimum of external parties in order to protect their core technology (including the new developed technology) and to capture the value on the market. If not, companies will ally with other partners through collaboration, spin-off, licensing out.. in order to make sure that they receive some revenue from a technology that they cannot market themselves (or at a much higher cost).	open innovation *** innovation systems *** business strategies *** open innovation *** life cycle *** open innovation *** globalisation and open innovation	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)4	Module 3: Open Innovation and Policy: Some first insights	2007	R	8. The case study exercise thus far has highlighted the importance of IP protection but has also identified other factors such as trust and commitment as especially important for open innovation strategies to succeed. Some preliminary implications for policies   Framework conditions, not least those that affect the business environment, education, the public research base, the ICT infrastructure, etc, become more important for attracting research from abroad but also in making countries (including their research systems) more open.  lntegration and coherence of innovation policies would help actors respond better to globalisation and open innovation. Such an in integrated approach, however, is difficult to implement partly due to the institutional barriers to co-operation in policy making and implementation; their removal would help improve effectiveness of policy.  lnnovation is distributed now and value comes from networks that extend beyond subsidiaries of firms and that allow firms to tap into the most innovative resources. Networking policies and instruments, especially those that encourage alliances and upstream collaboration and that can boost the co-operation capabilities of chabadu chabados are important.  User-driven innovation will be important and this can be facilitated through ICTs and appropriate consumer protection regulations and IP arrangements  Building talent and entrepreneurship for this new model of innovation will require changes to training and incentives.  The key challenge for INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs is balancing protection and knowledge sharing. The own and protect model for intellectual property must give way to a new own and share model. At the same time, this requires that firms must be able to differentiate where on the value chain do they share IP and where do they hold on to it.  Well functioning capital markets that allow for corporate venturing and exits on secondary markets are important for open innovation strategies.  A shift in the attitudes towards innovation is necessary to be able to move from the not- invented- here syndrome and to embrace and integrate external knowledge and technologies.  Measurement of globalisation and open innovation are critical for policy making. Understanding how open innovation works at the }unction of service and manufacturing sectors or between small and large firms is necessary to develop appropriate policies.	open innovation *** public research *** research system *** business environment *** framework conditions *** research base *** globalisation and open innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** model of innovation *** business models *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** value chains *** open innovation *** technological knowledge *** globalisation and open innovation *** open innovation *** open innovation	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)5	Proposal for TIP work on INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs in international collaboration in Research and Development and innovation	2007	S	For TIP, the growing importance of open business models, open science initiatives and open innovation begs the question of how can IP be best managed in collaborative Research and Development and innovation projects that cut across borders, but also that involve different types of IP and firms of different size and sectors as well as public research organisations (PROs). The types of intellectual property which are commonly subject to negotiation in research collaborations include patents, trade secrets, copyrights (e.g. software or educational materials.) Also important are database rights; registered designs and design rights as well as lay-out designs (semi-conductor, topography rights) of integrated circuits; and both registered and unregistered trademarks. the regulatory frameworks in which firms operate nationally and across borders affect the extent to which end innovation results in new products or services. However, and despite the common trend towards the harmonisation of IP regimes, for example in terms of the administrative management of patents in the Triad, national differences in IP policies and practices can act as a barriers to cross-border collaboration and open innovation. These barriers may result from the limitations to IP sharing arrangements due to national differences in joint patenting procedures or licensing arrangements or national differences in the way anti-trust and competition policies treat knowledge-sharing agreements. Barriers may also arise from asymmetries between firm capabilities in terms of technical competence and management skills as well as financial resources. Economic theory tells us that different size firms face different capital costs, but they also face different costs with regard to IP and collaboration. However, most intellectual property rights systems do not discriminate between large firms and chabadu chabados.  Differences in national IP enforcement and litigation systems can also affect the scope  for sharing IP in open innovation strategies. Such barriers may be especially problematic for smaller firms and start-ups which play a key role in open innovation strategies but which may have less resources and skills to manage and defend IP rights or enter into IP sharing agreements. On the other hand,  the emergence of open innovation business models presents an opportunity for small firms and entrepreneurs  to lower the costs of participation in collaborative innovation platforms. The focus of the TIP should be limited to identifying barriers and good practice solutions for IP management in international collaborative Research and Development and innovation, in particular in open innovation platforms. A special focus could be given to identifying practical examples of ways to ensure broader access to IP in the context of collaborative projects that aim to meet global challenges, thus contributing to work proposed in the IRD. The TIP work should aim to: (1) Provide policy makers with an analysis of the evolving role of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT in international Research and Development collaboration between firms but also involving public actors with a view to identify barriers and obstacles. (2) Provide qualitative analysis of different forms of IP and knowledge sharing mechanisms. (3) Provide quantitative analysis of available statistics and indicators that can be used to measure cross-border flows of IP in Research and Development collaboration, including joint patenting data. (4) Identify good practices and mechanisms for knowledge sharing in international Research and Development collaboration and open innovation.	open science *** business models *** research organisations *** collaborative research and development *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** collaborative research *** new products *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** competition policy *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** open innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** business models *** business innovation *** open innovation *** good practices *** intellectual property *** international collaborative research *** collaborative research and development *** open innovation *** global challenges *** international research *** intellectual property *** collaborative research and development *** collaborative research and development *** international research *** good practices *** collaborative research and development *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** international collaboration	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)6	Policy Mix for Innovation: outline of a synthesis report	2007	R	1. As part of its 2005-2006 Programme of Work, the TIP launched an activity on Peer Reviews of the Policy Mix for Innovation. The main purpose of the peer reviews was to produce a substantial set of cross-country information on the policy mix for Research and Development and innovation in order to provide guidance and ideas to countries considering reforms and improvement of their mix of innovation policies. It was expected that the information gathered and the analysis of the different countries would help countries to develop a better understanding of the issues to be considered in developing, evaluating or modifying their own policy mixes and to provide some examples the experience of different countries. The value of the peer-review lied in an analysis of distinct but inter-related policy areas that go beyond the review of standard indicators for benchmarking Research and Development and innovation. At the same time, being limited in scope , the policy mix reviews provided as an alternative to the more ambitious and in-depth CSTP country reviews of innovation policies. 2. In particular, the policy mix reviews examined key issues such as:  Is the overall policy mix is appropriate, efficient and effective?  Does the mix address the main innovation challenges facing the country or are there obvious gaps?  Is the balance across main policy domains consistent with the relative magnitude of the innovation challenges? Are there too many or too few instruments, and are they of an appropriate scale?   Are the individual instruments well-designed and effective (i.e., is the right type of instrument  used to address the particular problem to be solved and to the instruments build on good practice)? Are there synergies between and among individual instruments?  How does the governance structure for policy design and development relate with policy outcomes?	policy mix *** peer review *** policy mix *** peer review *** policy mix *** policy areas *** policy mix *** policy mix *** policy domain *** good practices *** governance arrangements *** policy mix	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)8	A PROPOSAL FOR ASSESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF PUBLIC Research and Development	2007	S	Understanding and measuring the effects of public Research and Development on society is not an easy task. Due to the specific nature of public Research and Development investment, which is often more oriented towards basic or fundamental research, the conceptual models that link public Research and Development investment with research outputs and their subsequent outcomes and impacts on society are complex. Challenges related to the attribution of impacts to specific Research and Development investments, the time lag required for impacts to accrue, or the measurement of non economic impacts are just a few examples of this complex relationship. The overall objective of this project is to improve our understanding of the relationship between public Research and Development investment and its socio-economic impacts. More specifically, the project aims at: Fostering a discussion between science policy researchers, economists and policy makers. Identifying national practices dealing with assessing the impacts of public Research and Development investment. Underpinning differences in national practices and impacts of public Research and Development. Highlighting particularly promising approaches towards measuring the impacts of public Research and Development. Learning lessons from countries that appear to achieve particularly large impacts from public Research and Development. Establishing a basis for improved cross-country comparative approaches and methodologies, including the establishment of new data sources and indicators.The Secretariat proposes a two step approach to increasing our understanding of the socio- economic impacts of public Research and Development and to improving the scientific approaches and methodologies that underpin the measurement of these impacts. (A) Stocktaking of recent developments in different countries to advance impact assessment, including available cross-country studies. This first phase would involve an effort by the Secretariat to bring together existing practices, helping to define the State of the Art in the field. Countries would be invited to provide existing material and studies. The work should clearly identify the approaches, methodologies, including model and indicators, and objectives. The Secretariat synthesis could form the basis for a workshop to share existing practices, which could draw on work currently underway in countries. (B) Identification of promising alternatives to improve the assessment of investments in public Research and Development. This activity would build on the results of the first phase. It could involve the establishment of cross-country comparable approaches and methodologies, the development of new data sources and indicators, etc. This activity would need to be closely aligned with existing work on indicators and with the work on evaluation, that may also involve further work on indicators	public research and development *** research and development expenditures *** fundamental research *** public research and development *** economic impacts *** research and development expenditures *** economic impacts *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** socio-economic impacts *** impacts of public research *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** impact assessment *** public research and development *** public investment in research *** impacts of public research *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** socio-economic impacts	policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)8	A PROPOSAL FOR ASSESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF PUBLIC Research and Development (bis)	2007	S	The 10 main challenges for analysing the economic and non- economic impacts of public Research and Development  (1) Managing the technology-economic and non-economic impact interface. The linkage between research inputs, outputs and impacts (or outcomes): There is typically no direct link between a research investment and an impact. Research inputs generate some specific outputs that will then have an impact on society. Therefore, the relationship is always indirect and therefore more difficult to identify and measure. lt is almost impossible to isolate the influence of one specific factor (research output) on one impact, because the latter is in general affected by several factors, which are difficult to control for. Besides, in many cases, the causality between research outputs and impacts are not thoroughly demonstrated. (2) Sector specific outputs and impact- Each specific research field-industry has its own specificities on how outputs are created and channelled to the end users. The definition of a one solution fits all framework is therefore not valid, and each research field needs to define its own specific framework. (3) Existence of multiple dimensions of benefits: Basic research may have an impact in more than one dimension and in order to assess the full impact of an investment, all these benefits need to be identified. (4) ldentification of users: The identification of all end users who benefit from the research outputs can be difficult and/or costly, especially in the case of basic research. (5) ldentification and understanding of the transfer mechanism: lt is difficult to identify and describe all the potential mechanisms to transfer research results to society, to the end users. ln this respect, there have been studies that identify mechanisms of transfer between businesses or between universities and businesses, etc. These models are mainly empirical, rather than based on a solid theoretical background, and they leave the real impact on society of those transfers unrevealed. (6) Definition of appropriate impact indicators: The difficulty to define appropriate benefit categories, relevant transfer mechanisms and end users translates in the difficulty to define and measure appropriate impact indicators related to specific research outputs. (7) Role of international spillovers on impacts: The existence of knowledge spillovers has been well  documented and demonstrated (Jaffe 1986, Grilliches, 1979). As a result, specific impacts could be partially the result of internationally performed research, and therefore it could be difficult to identify the real impact  of a national research investment. (8) The time lag between the investment and the impact: Different research investments may have different time frameworks to have an impact on society, and some times it may be premature to try to measure the impact, as different investments may require different time leads to generate full impacts. This is particularly true in the case of basic research. (9) Role of interdisciplinary outputs: Research outputs, e.g. improved skills, may contribute to a set of different impacts, and therefore it may be difficult to identify them all in order to evaluate the contribution of the specific output, let alone that one of the research investment. (10) Difficulty  in  valuating  (providing  a  monetary  value)  the  impacts to  make  them  comparable.  Even if identifiable, non economic impacts may be difficult to value in a common measure, making them incomparable. There have been some attempts to translate some of these impacts, e.g. economic savings of healthy population, calculation of opinion values, into economic terms, but they have remained either partial and/or open to subjectivity.	public research and development *** research and development expenditures *** fundamental research *** public research and development *** economic impacts *** research and development expenditures *** economic impacts *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** socio-economic impacts *** impacts of public research *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** impact assessment *** public research and development *** public investment in research *** impacts of public research *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** socio-economic impacts	policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)9	Draft outline of the Science, Technology and Industry Outlook 2008	2007	O	The Outlook will place its emphasis on three types of analysis:1)general overviews of trends in science, technology and innovation, and related policies in member countries and observers to the CSTP; 2) country profiles; and 3) assessment of the impacts of science and innovation. Rather than include a range of thematic chapters drawing on ongoing CSTP work, the 2008 Outlook will primarily focus on indicators and benchmarking science, technology and innovation performance. The first chapter will be an extended version of the previous editions of the Outlook. It will provide a general overview of main trends in science, technology and innovation over the past few years, drawing on available OECD statistical indicators and other material. It will highlight the continued shift toward knowledge-based economies across the OECD and a growing number of non-Member countries, as well as the growing recognition of innovation as a determinant of economic performance. It will also explore the implications of increasing levels of innovative activity on global demand for resources for innovation (e.g. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and human resources). The chapter will also examine trends in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT performance, innovation performance (e.g. through the use of the latest results from the Community Innovation Survey), patenting, scientific publications and internationalisation of science, technology and innovation. This chapter will review and discuss recent developments in science, technology and innovation policy. It will also highlight new and innovative policy practices. The chapter will begin with a general overview of major changes in S&T and innovation policies, and the institutional structures in which they take place (e.g. changes in Ministries responsible for science, technology and innovation policy). In keeping with enduring themes of recent DSTI work, the chapter will subsequently address policy developments related to the financing and governance of public sector research, government incentives for business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and innovation, industry-science linkages, inter-firm collaboration and open innovation and human resources for S&T. It will also review recent changes in rules or regulations governing evaluation of innovation policy. Issues related to globalisation and intellectual property rights will also be addressed. Chapter 4 will be on Assessing science, technology and innovation impacts. the chapter will discuss methodological issues and good practices for evaluating and assessing the impacts of science and innovation policy at the programme and institutional levels. The chapter would also draw on work in the NESTI to develop new indicators of commercialisation and other outputs and impacts from investments in science and technology. a special focus could be given to lessons arising from efforts to assess the impacts of certain of generic technologies (ICT's, biotechnology, nanotechnology) on the economy or in meeting global challenges (e.g climate change, energy, health etc).	innovation performance *** knowledge-based economy *** innovation activities *** human resources *** innovation performance *** scientific publications *** policy practices *** policy development *** business research and development *** human resources *** industry-science relationships *** open innovation *** public research sector *** intellectual property *** good practices *** global challenges	objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)11	NATIONAL CASE STUDIES ON THE ARCHITECTURE FOR EVALUATION	2008	R	1. The overall framework or architecture for evaluation of science and technology is a critical element in national innovation systems. As part of the CSTP project on evaluation, the TIP has undertaken a series of country case studies1 that examine the elements of evaluation systems, the different actors, and their linkages and the relationship between evaluation pillars and policy design and implementation, in particular at programme, policy and institutional levels. 2. The case studies presented in this document illustrate variety both with regard to the comprehensiveness of the evaluation systems, the objectives of the evaluations, the way in which they are conducted and the used for policy making. Of the five countries in this report, Finland is the country which is the closest to having a comprehensive system for evaluation. By comprehensive, it is understood to  mean that evaluation is everywhere, from the evaluation of the countrys performance as a system to the evaluation of programmes. In Finland all publicly funded research is evaluated, whether it takes place in universities or other research organisations. The evaluations are conducted by the Academy of Sciences and TEKES. Finland plans to conduct an impact assessment of the entire national innovation system in the near future. 3. In the other countries the responsibility for evaluation, the organisation and subsequent execution follow clearly delineated lines according to the focus of research or the funding streams. In Japan, for example, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) evaluates the competitive research funding to industry while responsibility for evaluating non-competitive research subsidies falls on the performing agencies, such as the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), which has responsibility for evaluating its own (applied research) projects (which are subsidized by METI), and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). In China, the Ministry of Science and Technology has responsibility for evaluating national research programmes (e.g. National Hi-tech Research and Development Program or the National Key Basic Research Development Program) which have served to concentrate and allocate public resources on priority areas for the social and economic development of China. In Norway, in contrast, fields of basic research in universities are evaluated by the Norwegian Research Council. 4. For all countries, the rationale for evaluation is to improve their Research and Development performance and to ensure efficient use of the resources invested. The roles of the ministries, however, differ among the countries. While the ministries play an active role in Japan and China, in other countries, the evaluation is delegated to research councils or other funding bodies. Evaluation is also grounded in the legal framework and regulations whether at the level of the national government (Finland government resolution 2005) or the funding agency or research council. In China, until recently, there were no laws or regulations for Research and Development evaluation. The regulations aim at promote the evaluation of Research and Development. Clear established guidelines such as  1. The countries participating in the case studies on the architecture of evaluation systems are China, Finland, France, Israel, Japan, Korea and Norway. TIP Delegates have reviewed the case study of Koreas evaluation system previously [DSTI/STP/TIP(2007)7]. This volume presents the recently completed case studies in 2008. The case study of France is still underway and will be integrated subsequently and included in the final publication.   those set out by METIs newly created Technology Evaluation and Research Division are also important to institutionalise and standardise evaluations practices. 5. It appears however, that the goal of using the results of evaluation for funding decisions, in particular budgeting decisions, is not explicit in the countries under study. This is case in China where evaluation is used more for improving existing programs than for supporting resource allocation or priority setting. The objectives of the evaluations differ and depend on the policies/programme being evaluated, whether the programme focus on co-operation between universities and businesses as in the case of Israel and Japan or on the quality of research programmes (e.g. in China). In other cases, assessing the social and economic impacts is an explicit goal of the evaluations such as in Finland and Israel. In Norway, given the focus on funding basic research, the evaluations aim to improve quality. 6. The mechanisms and tools for evaluation differ depending on the level of evaluation and countries. While Norway and Finland the evaluations are based mainly on peer review, the other countries used expert teams. In China, evaluations of large national programme involve several tools, including consultation of peers in the process. In Japan, peer review and expert review are both used as are interviews. 7. In all countries, those evaluated  whether researchers, programme managers or firms, play an important role in the process. A common challenge seems to be availability of data on research. While data and bibliometric methods were used in Norway and Finland, and a range of other indicators are used in Japan, qualitative information such as that collected from interviews are also very important. 8. Addressing social and economic impacts remains a challenge for most countries, mainly due to the difficulty of attributing impact variable to a particular research programme, particularly after a lapse of several years. Scientific impact is easier to measure than social impact, and impact of applied research is more easily measured than basic research. This represents a considerable challenge. Finland is actively undertaking foresight studies with the aim to combine these with impact evaluations of Research and Development. In the case of Japan, one of the vital roles of the follow-up evaluation is to identify negative impacts and their linkages to research programmes. 9. What are the consequences of evaluations? From the case studies in this volume, the outcomes of evaluations appear to have the greatest influence on improving the design, implementation and effectiveness of programmes. Evaluations have a more limited impact on the policy decision for funding, with the exception of evaluations of basic research programmes (e.g. the Norwegian Research Council). Lastly, in the countries surveyed, evaluations are made public with the exception of China. However, the diffusion and dissemination of evaluations can help improve policy learning both with regard to the quality and process of evaluations as well as with regard to the results of the evaluations themselves.	national innovation systems *** evaluation systems *** evaluation systems *** funded research *** research organisations *** impact assessment *** national innovation systems *** funded research *** applied research *** technology development *** research programmes *** basic research *** basic research *** funding agencies *** evaluation of research *** evaluation systems *** evaluation systems *** resource allocation *** priority setting *** research programmes *** economic impacts *** basic research *** evaluation tools *** peer review *** peer review *** research programmes *** economic impacts *** applied research *** socio-economic impacts *** basic research *** research programmes *** research programmes *** basic research	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)13	FOSTERING NEW FORMS OF INNOVATION - PROPOSAL FOR FURTHER WORK IN 2009-2010	2008	S	At the June meeting of the Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP), Delegates approved activity proposal 2.1 Adapting policies to new forms of, and new actors in, innovation, including non-technological innovation and innovation in services. there is growing recognition that innovation is more than Research and Development and technology and  that much of the innovation that takes place in the economy is not fully reflected in statistical measures and that there is a technological bias in policy thinking. Statistical measures of innovation have thus far been dominated by indicators of Research and Development activities and by output indicators like patenting and scientific publications. In recent years, however, interest has grown in non-technological forms of innovation and its contribution to productivity performance, including in countries where industrial specialisation and structure limit the scope for formal and technology-based Research and Development activities. This interest also reflects a growing understanding of the interaction between and complementary nature of technological and non-technological innovation, such as the key role of organisational change in the implementation of information and communication technologies. The focus on non-technological forms of innovation has been most acute in services sector, which now accounts for more than 70% of GDP in OECD countries. OECD work on services innovation for example has found evidence that services firms innovate in ways that involve non- formal Research and Development, the purchasing and application of existing technologies such as ICTs, as well as the introduction of new business models and implementation of organisational changes. Innovation is not only broadening in the forms it takes, but also in the actors involved. For example, social entrepreneurs, philanthropies and non-profit foundations have become active players in supporting innovation to address social challenges (e.g. poverty, neglected diseases). These actors are primarily engaged in social innovation, aimed at improving the welfare of individuals and communities and at satisfying needs not met by the market. Information and communications technology, including the Internet, play a key role in enabling open platforms for innovation that allow new types of collaboration, new research methods, and new types of technological and organisational innovation. Users, including consumers and suppliers play a growing role in innovation, with consumers increasingly demanding goods and services that are tailored to their specific needs. These (and other) changes in the innovation process present several challenges to existing national policy frameworks. A first question concerns the relative importance and role of new forms of innovation and the weight they should have in innovation policy. A closely related second question concerns the factors and policies determining new forms of innovation. A third question concerns specific policies that may help foster new forms of innovation. Broadening policies (where appropriate) to capture new forms of innovation may help to address some of the changes in the innovation process. However, there is also a question to what extent policies should be broadened to provide incentives or support new actors in the innovation process, e.g. charities and non-profit foundations, consumers, etc. Considering the existing and planned work in other areas, and the policy questions raised above, there are two axis of work that the TIP may wish to consider for 2009-2010, namely: i) collecting further information and evidence on the changing nature of innovation and its drivers and ii) examining policy responses and identifying policy implications. The TIP activity would therefore aim to: a) identify and gather evidence on new forms of innovation across OECD Countries; b) carry out case studies on new forms of innovation in selected  sectors in OECD countries; c) examine the implications for policies with a view to identify good practices and promising approaches for national innovation strategies. the TIP may consider focusing its case studies as follows: Activity I: Exploring new forms of innovation. Activity II: New actors in the innovation process. Activity III: Designing Policies for New Forms of Innovation.	new actors *** new forms of innovation *** innovation in services *** research and development activities *** scientific publications *** research and development activities *** services sector *** business models *** existing technologies *** innovation in services *** support innovation *** organisational innovations *** innovation process *** policy frameworks *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** innovation process *** new forms of innovation *** innovation process *** new actors *** good practices *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** innovation process *** new actors *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation	firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)14	ADJUSTING POLICIES TO THE GLOBALISATION OF INNOVATION - PROPOSAL FOR WORK IN 2009-2010	2008	S	Recent OECD work has focused in considerable detail on the globalisation process, including the internationalisation of science and innovation. This work points to a dramatic shift in the internationalisation of business research, technology and innovation, and in the nature of this process. New technological opportunities, notably ICT, are among the main drivers of the internationalisation process as these have enabled new ways of collaboration and have led to greater specialisation in the global innovation system. The emergence of new global players, such as China and India, is another major factor in this shift. A growing number of countries have developed important Science and Technology capabilities in recent years. This work also showed that decisions where to locate innovative activities are primarily related to the market potential and the quality of skills. Overall, empirical analysis and case studies show that the internationalisation of innovative activities can bring substantial benefits, e.g. greater cost efficiency in the innovation process, greater ability to learn about innovation conducted by other companies/institutions, a reduced time length before commercialisation and a positive impact on the innovation capacity of the own firm. At the same time, concerns are raised in many countries, notably the possible erosion of home based innovative activities by off-shoring and outsourcing abroad that could result in a reduced capacity to absorb knowledge and technologies developed abroad. The globalisation process is also accompanied by a growing mobility of highly skilled talent across borders. For receiving countries, the inflow of talent spurs a variety of positive effects related to knowledge flows, Research and Development and creativity. These include the possibility for increased Research and Development and economic activity due to the availability of additional skilled workers, improved knowledge flows and collaboration with sending countries, increased enrolment in graduate programmes, and potential firm and job creation by immigrant entrepreneurs. For sending countries, work on the effects of emigration has often focused on migrant  remittances and brain drain, with a particular emphasis on the impacts on developing countries. Recent literature also points to the benefits of brain circulation in transferring knowledge to sending countries. Brain circulation can refer to the return of skilled migrants to their home country after a period abroad, or to a pattern of temporary and circular migration between home and abroad. The emergence of global value chains and global innovation networks raises new policy issues for OECD countries. A first common policy concern (also identified at the CSTP high-level meeting in March 2008) simply relates to understanding the process and having sound evidence to underpin policies. A second issue concerns the implications of the globalisation of innovation for existing framework and innovation policies. It reinforces some general principles, such as the need for sound macroeconomic  and structural policies; policies to foster exchange and openness, e.g. openness to FDI and trade, openness to highly skilled workers from abroad; sufficient protection of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, as well as good conditions for entrepreneurship, as a way of bringing new ideas into the marketplace. But the attractiveness of national economies for innovation may depend on more than framework conditions. One important determinant of location includes the knowledge capabilities that various countries have to offer, for example in offering an abundant and high-skilled labour force that offers talent that firms can use. Effective knowledge institutions that engage in basic research and provide relevant knowledge for innovation also play an important role. Policy questions in this context relate to the importance of various demand and supply factors for the attractiveness of countries for Research and Development activities and how countries (but also regions and cities) can develop into hubs within global value chains? These three aspects, i.e. 1) measurement of impacts and spill-overs; 2) factors determining attractiveness; and 3) implications for innovation policy, could all be examined in more detail.  Activity I: Measurement of the impacts and spill-overs of globalisation. This work  could analyse the impacts and measure the international spill-overs of internationalisation. This work could be particularly relevant in a context of possibly more protectionist views on innovation. One possible approach to this project could be to arrange for an expert workshop with invited papers on precisely this topic, in cooperation with other OECD bodies.  Activity II: Analysis of implications of globalisation for specific policy instruments. This work would primarily focus on questions related to the effectiveness and relevance of existing policies, including innovation policies, in the increasingly global environment for innovation. It could describe and analyse existing approaches and policies to address the globalisation of innovation, would draw on existing experiences and policy evaluations in member countries, and would ultimately aim at the development of good practices. Depending on the interests of TIP, it could focus on specific policy instruments, e.g. direct and indirect support policies for business Research and Development. Such  funding policy instruments  are more  likely to be  influenced  by the internationalisation of Research and Development than policies aimed at developing infrastructure, human resources or networks. They may therefore provide a particularly relevant avenue for TIP work.  Activity III: Supporting the development of a comprehensive approach to the globalisation of innovation in the context of the OECD Innovation Strategy. Activities I and II are important  and discrete projects that could be undertaken by TIP and that would address important gaps in the current understanding of policy makers in this area. However, the Innovation Strategy will require a comprehensive perspective on how to adjust policies to the globalisation of innovation. TIP may therefore wish to play a pro-active role in developing such a view, based on its experience and existing work	globalisation process *** business research and development *** innovation systems *** innovation activities *** innovation activities *** innovation process *** innovation capacity *** technological knowledge *** innovation activities *** globalisation process *** knowledge flows *** knowledge flows *** job creation *** knowledge transfer *** home country *** global innovation networks *** global value chains *** globalisation of innovation *** intellectual property *** framework conditions *** skilled labour *** basic research *** global value chains *** research and development activities *** policy instruments *** good practices *** globalisation of innovation *** policy evaluations *** policy instruments *** business research and development *** human resources *** internationalisation of research *** policy development *** policy instruments *** globalisation of innovation *** globalisation of innovation *** globalisation of innovation	internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)15	PROPOSED ROAD-MAP FOR WORK ON EVALUATION AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT	2008	S	Part A Background. The TIP has just completed a project on Assessing the socio-economic impacts of public Research and Development as part of its 2007-2008 programme of work. Among the findings are that: (1) The rationale for impact assessment is expanding, but fundamentally, it is to assess the contribution of public Research and Development to achieving public objectives. More precisely, governments increasingly seek to determine how much they should invest in Research and Development, identify where to invest and anticipate what society gets in return. Ideally, an impact analysis should help determine  both the economic effects of public investment in Research and Development, such as the contribution to growth, and the social impacts, such as better health outcomes. Moreover, policy makers also increasingly want public investment to help meet global challenges, such as energy security and climate change. (2) Measuring impacts is neither straightforward nor an easy task especially as regards demonstrating causality. There are different mechanisms through which the benefits of public research spill over to society. Furthermore, many of the dimensions through which Science and Technology affect society (e.g. societal, cultural or environmental impacts) are not easily captured by existing national statistical frameworks, as they are less tangible and therefore difficult to measure or evaluate and therefore difficult to link to policy interventions. (3) Choice of methodology is not universal but context specific. The TIP project showed that impact assessment methodologies are not universally applicable, but rather context specific and therefore results are not easily comparable. The context varies depending on the objective of the impact assessment exercise, the timing of the exercise (ex ante and/or ex post); and the scope and nature of Research and Development. The TIP review found top-down approaches, especially econometric and mathematical models, better suited to assess impacts affecting the whole research system and dealing with all types of research, both basic and applied. In particular, mathematical models, such as general equilibrium or similar models may be a good way to assess systemic impacts ex ante. On the other hand, when the subject of the assessment is a research programme and/or institution that aims at developing a specific type of technology with a clear industrial focus, bottom-up approaches may be favoured. (4) New and useful practices are being developed to assess impacts but methodological issues remain as does the issue of the (international) comparability. Some of the most promising and forward- looking practices include general equilibrium models, econometric analyses, data linkages and scientometrics methods, survey-based indicators combined with econometric analyses and case studies. These various methodologies are still evolving but until now, none of the available techniques has been able to capture the full range of impacts of public Research and Development on society, although they have opened new and encouraging lines of investigation. Part B potential further work by TIP. The question where TIP should focus its effort in light of different national and international activities was discussed by the TIP Steering Group on impact assessment. Two main areas where  identified, in particular work on: (i) Improving methodological approaches for assessing the impacts of public Research and Development. Although TIP is more concerned with the use of impact assessment for guiding policy making, it can contribute to broader efforts to improve methodologies. (2) Improving international comparability of the assessment of socio-economic impacts of public Research and Development. However, the steering group also noted there could be a trade-off between relevance and comparability. Three activities are proposed. Activity I. Typology of Impact Assessments related to policy interventions. Different types of policy interventions require different types of methodologies for assessing their impacts. The idea is to develop a guide book for policy makers so that those that wish to develop an Research and Development tax credit for example, are aware of the types of impact assessment tools that can be used, ex ante or ex  post to be used so that the most appropriate and up-to-date tools are applied. Given the focus of TIP, the working party may wish to focus on policy interventions in public Research and Development. Activity II. Case studies of evaluation and impact assessment of policy interventions  could be undertaken to validate the typology developed above and provide insights for improving the international comparability of impact assessments. In addition to interventions such as tax credits, innovation vouchers or other more demand-related policy interventions could be the subject of the case studies either alone or as part of an the assessment of a policy mix. Activity III: Mapping and comparing the performance of national innovation systems. This work would draw on existing indicators and empirical analysis, including the NESTI work on micro data, to develop more complete and systemic descriptions of national innovation systems.  It would use the full set of existing national and international data on science, technology and innovation performance to compare inputs, outcomes and impacts, and could also explore possible indicators of policies affecting science, technology and innovation performance.	economic impacts *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** socio-economic impacts *** public research and development *** impact assessment *** public investment in research *** socio-economic impacts *** public investment in research *** global challenges *** public research *** policy interventions *** impact assessment *** impact assessment *** research system *** research programmes *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** impact assessment *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** impact assessment *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** socio-economic impacts *** policy interventions *** impact assessment *** policy interventions *** impact assessment *** tax incentives *** public research and development *** policy interventions *** policy interventions *** evaluation and impact assessment *** tax incentives *** policy mix *** policy interventions *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** evaluation and impact assessment	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)16	FOSTERING DEMAND FOR INNOVATION AND ADDRESSING GLOBAL CHALLENGES - PROPOSAL FOR WORK IN 2009-2010	2008	S	The rationale for bringing these two activities together is based on two lines of thinking: first, many of the problems in mobilising science, technology and innovation to stimulate economic growth and address global challenges are related not only to insufficient investment in innovation activities or inappropriate technology (i.e. supply) but also by the lack of relevant markets (i.e. demand) for innovative products and services. Second, while global challenges such as climate change, population ageing, water and energy security are increasing demand for innovative solutions, well-functioning markets (and thus demand) for innovative solutions are lacking for several of these challenges. Traditionally  the rationale for government intervention has focused on market failures that cause agents to under-invest in innovative activities. Most policy interventions have therefore focused on the supply-side and on framework conditions that affect incentives for investment in innovation. There is however, growing interest in the demand side of innovation. This interest takes place at several levels. First, the literature on national innovation systems has long recognised that innovation is not a linear process and involves strong interactions and feedback between supply and demand. Second, there is a growing recognition in many countries that poor innovation performance often does not stem from lack of technology or innovative solutions, but from low demand or lacking markets for innovation. Understanding why there is little  demand for innovation in many markets is important for policy makers wishing to foster innovation for economic growth and the addressing of global challenges. In some cases, particularly innovation to address global challenges, market failures may lead to sub-optimal amounts of innovation. For example, inventors may not be able to reap the full profit from their inventions or externalities may imply that the costs and benefits of innovation are not fully reflected in market prices. Addressing the first form of failure implies making sure innovators get credit for their inventions that are of value to society-at-large, and addressing the second implies getting the prices right, so that the costs and benefits of actions are clear. The ability to internalise externalities depends on both efficient markets and regulations (e.g. setting the price of CO2 emissions to foster investment in climate- friendly Research and Development). Fostering market development by getting prices right through a variety of economic instruments (e.g. taxation, trading permits or other schemes) is typically considered the optimal way to develop demand for innovative products in areas such as climate change. government is a large actor in the market, notably through its procurement of goods and services, and is thus in a position to foster demand for innovative products, in particular in areas where it is a large customer (e.g. roads, public health care,  but also ICT). Edler (2006) identifies 5 key areas that prevent innovations from being taken up by the market and examines the potential role of public procurement as a solution: High entry costs, Lack of information or awareness, Transaction costs, Lock in-effects and path dependencies, Lack of network effects. Standards and regulatory measures serve a similar purpose and have been applied in several policy areas. User-driven innovation is also receiving growing interest to boost innovation through customization. Many OECD countries have launched initiatives to foster demand for innovation. Recent examples include: Lead Markets, The Dutch Launching Customer (LC) plan, EC Framework for State Aid Initiatives. The development of policies to foster demand faces several challenges. First, such policies are  not without risks and drawbacks. Public procurement for innovation in particular raises important issues of governance and coherence between purchasing and the governments own efforts to support research and innovation in the public and private sectors. Another problem arises from the fragmentation of demand in the public sector; with demand coming from different agencies or at the different levels. Compared with other projects to be undertaken by the TIP, this project addresses questions that are relatively new for the OECD and for many OECD countries. Considering this status, the Secretariat proposes the following approach: (i) The economics of demand-side innovation and policies. (ii) Identifying good practices and approaches and the role of demand policies in overall innovation policy. (iii) The global context. In a third (potential stage), the work could look more explicitly at the role of demand-side policies in addressing global challenges.	innovation activities *** economic growth *** innovation investments *** global challenges *** innovative products *** global challenges *** innovation activities *** market failures *** innovation investments *** framework conditions *** policy interventions *** demand-side policies *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** economic growth *** global challenges *** global challenges *** market failures *** economic instruments *** innovative products *** innovative products *** health care *** public procurement *** policy areas *** policy development *** support research *** public procurement *** private sector *** public sector *** demand-side policies *** good practices *** global challenges *** global challenges	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** other_policy_areas *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges

This document is a progress report on the implementation of the programme of country reviews of innovation policy, with a special focus on the ongoing effort to synthesise interim findings. Reflecting preliminary discussions within the CSTP in October 2008 it highlights the issues which have emerged as the most important to be addressed in a synthesis, and provides a preliminary draft on those related to governance of innovation systems. This document is a progress report on the implementation of the programme of country reviews of innovation policy, with a special focus on the ongoing effort to synthesise interim findings. Reflecting preliminary discussions within the CSTP in October 2008 it highlights the issues which have emerged as the most important to be addressed in a synthesis, and provides a preliminary draft on those related to governance of innovation systems. Objectives of the synthesis. he synthesis would contribute to the OECD Innovation Strategy by basing it firmly on a rich set of evidence of concrete country experiences regarding both the evolving nature of innovation processes and the ability of public policy to boost the performance of innovation systems. it would provide insights on how to improve country-specific work, with a view to increase its value for national policy decision processes. GOVERNANCE OF THE INNOVATION SYSTEM. Here we define STI governance as the set of publicly defined institutional arrangements, incentive structures etc., which determine how the various public and private actors in socio-economic development interact in allocating and managing resources devoted to innovation. STI governance involves developing capacities in three key related areas, namely agenda-setting, implementation, and adaptive learning. These are represented as three sides of a triangle that has been divided into four areas. At the heart of the triangle are those structural factors that operate over space and time, framing and influencing the governance systems approach to agenda-setting, implementation and adaptive learning. While these shaping factors both enable and constrain actions, they are not immutable. Instead, they are themselves dynamically constructed through the interplay of endogenous and exogenous factors, including by those actions upon which they have an influence. Thus, the growth in NPM thinking has seen big increases in the number of agencies in the STI governance landscape. But other factors have also contributed to this growth, including (i) the growing importance of STI in public policy and an enhanced appreciation of its complexity; (ii) the growth in multi- scalar governance; and (iii) bureaucratic or interest rivalry in the desire to own the STI agenda. A combination of these factors has led to considerable complexity in the institutional landscape, making system co-ordination and coherence challenging. But an initial question is why such co-ordination should have become so important. the process of governance is an interactive one since no single actor has the knowledge and resource capacity to tackle problems unilaterally. This leads to a focus on the co-ordination of multiple actors and institutions to formulate and implement policy goals in complex political arenas. achieving co-ordination and coherence is a difficult challenge for governments, which are generally ill-equipped to deal with cross-cutting policy issues such as innovation. Coherence involves not only co-ordination of simultaneous policy actions, but also an evaluation of their possible interaction with policies pursuing other primary objectives. This concerns first of all the core set of innovation policies such as S&T and education, but there are a number of other policies whose impacts must also be taken into account, e.g. taxation policy, competition laws and regulations, etc.  the framework conditions for innovation. Thus, innovation policy is compartmentalised in different departments and agencies that often compete for power rather than cooperate to tackle policy issues. It is therefore important that systems are put in place to ensure that different policies and programmes have an overall coherence, otherwise there is considerable risk they could cancel one another out. This can be achieved at different points in the governance system, e.g. in agenda-setting processes through, for example, the establishment of high-level policy councils, the merger of institutions, and/or the formulation of strategic, long-term policies and visions that set a legitimate direction for priority setting. But it can also be achieved in implementation processes through joint-programming and the like. The need for the latter is in fact accentuated by the growth of agencies, since NPM arrangements, with their strong focus on vertical co-ordination and tightly-bound service missions have sometimes tended to inhibit horizontal co-ordination. However, from an institutional perspective, the impact of effective horizontal integration is a loosening of control and the introduction of greater complexity into policy implementation processes. Matters have been further complicated by the growth of international governmental organisations (IGOs) and international regulations, e.g. the WTO TRIPS Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, etc. that increasingly shape governance regimes. A related driver concerns globalisation, which has seen not only an increase in the importance of IGOs, but also the emergence of powerful new actors in the shape of transnational corporations. This type of actor is hardly new of course, but their growth in both size and number has given them a new prominence in STI governance systems, particularly as states increasingly compete to attract their investments. Besides the growth in prominence of internationalised actors, the idea of a globalised world has also had a profound effect on STI policy governance. For example, national STI policy is increasingly framed in global terms, reflecting a growing sense of global identity, the global nature of many problems and issues, and the globalisation of markets and production. Shifts in STI dynamics are important to take into account when designing and justifying STI policy interventions and can be an important spur to the development of new policy intervention rationales and instruments. Policy tools should be embedded in current rationales, but it is also possible that rationales evolve while policy tools remain in place (on account of inertia), disconnected from contemporary rationales. In this case, policy tools live a life of their own. However, it is more common that newer rationales do not fully invalidate earlier instrument choices and the goals associated with previous rationales. The overall effect is another layer of instruments overlaying existing ones, thereby increasing policy complexity.	innovation systems *** innovation systems *** innovation process *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** incentive structures *** governance arrangements *** institutional arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** framework conditions *** priority setting *** policy implementation *** new actors *** governance arrangements *** policy interventions *** policy profiles *** policy profiles	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes

DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)3	POTENTIAL FURTHER WORK BY THE TIP ON ASSESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF PUBLIC Research and Development	2008	S	Over the past 12 months, the TIP has worked on this issue, and so far, two main activities have been carried out : A review of a number of promising methodological practices used in OECD countries to assess public Research and Development impacts; The organisation of a thematic workshop aimed at sharing information on good practices to assess public Research and Development Impacts. The two main challenges where the TIP could contribute to shed more light have been identified: Developing sound methodological approaches in order to get a better handle of the impacts of public Research and Development; Developing benchmark indicators that allow for the international comparison of socio-economic impacts. In order to overcome these challenges and keep advancing our knowledge on the impacts of public Research and Development investments and the creation of benchmarks allowing for international comparisons, the Secretariat proposes three strands of activities. Strand 1: Undertake a series of case studies where research assessments, being carried out at public research institutions or in centres of excellence could apply the same methodology to increase the comparability of results. Perhaps, one of the main shortcomings in the field of impact assessment is the absence of any meaningful benchmarks that allow for international comparisons of the impacts of public Research and Development in different countries. From the earlier review for CSTP and TIP, it became clear that impact assessment  methodologies are not universally applicable, but rather context specific ; and therefore, results are not easily comparable. This context can be categorised by a number of different variables that range from : The objective of the impact assessment exercise (e.g. overall investment in public Research and Development, public research organisations, centres of excellence (tied or not tied to a single physical institution, or large-scale and specific public research programmes) ; The timing of the assessment (i.e. ex-ante and/or ex-post); The scope and nature of the Research and Development : basic Research and Development vs. mission-oriented or industry-oriented Research and Development. Consequently, and in order to improve the international comparability of the result of impacts assessment exercises, the same methodology should be applied to similar types of public Research and Development investment. Although public Research and Development investments will certainly vary from case to case, understanding the similarities and differences in each case could help establish a common ground and understanding of the reasons behind the differences across various impact assessment exercises. Strand 2: Conceptual, methodological and empirical work to link public spending on Research and Development and other public investment in innovation to aggregate outcomes. Strand 3: organise a second thematic workshop to share upcoming advances in the  field  of methodology development and integration. Regional and national governments in OECD countries and elsewhere will keep working on improving the methodological tools to assess the impacts of public Research and Development investment. These approaches include better and improved econometric and general equilibrium models, data linkages, refinement of logic models to match and map inputs-outputs-outcomes-impacts, or integrated approaches using quantitative and qualitative approaches, are just a few examples of how methodologies may advanced.	good practices *** public research and development *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** socio-economic impacts *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** research organisations *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** impact assessment *** impact assessment *** impact assessment *** research programmes *** public research and development *** research organisations *** basic research *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** research and development expenditures *** impact assessment *** public research and development *** innovation investments *** public investment in research *** research and development expenditures *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** socio-economic impacts	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)4	THE ROLE OF EXPERT REVIEW IN THE EVALUATION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: ISSUES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR ADVANCED PRACTICES	2008	R	1. With the increasing focus on innovation to improve productivity growth as well as to help address global challenges such as climate change and energy security, there has been a growing focus on the evaluation of public support to Research and Development and innovation. In light of this, the CSTP has requested its Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP), together with the Working Group on Research Institutions and Human Resources (RIHR, formerly SFRI) to help OECD countries develop a better understanding of the issues in designing and implementing evaluation practices and methods. 2. In this context, the TIP is carrying work on expert reviews, a broader type of peer review, from its role in shaping research funding decisions (e.g. what, who and where to fund research) to its role in evaluating the output and impacts of public investment in Research and Development and innovation. 3. Expert review is in fact one of the most common methods used to evaluate public funding of science and technology. There are, however, some concerns that the expert review system is under pressure and facing a crisis of confidence among users because it depends on the professional but subjective decisions of individuals and because it is increasingly time consuming and resource intensive. 4. In light of its importance as a methodological tool for evaluation, part of the work has focused on the role of expert review as a tool for ex post and ex ante evaluations of research policies, programmes and public research organisations (PROs). The paper describes the definitions, process and use of expert review especially at programme and policy level, summarises the challenges, and finally suggests potential solutions to these challenges for policy makers. This paper however does not aim to be a guide or a handbook for programme managers in evaluation agencies. 5. As regards the key issues/challenges, the following questions have been identified:  How to reflect socioeconomic and political priorities effectively and link these priorities to decision making in expert review processes?  How can expert review be combined with other both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to improve evidence-based policy?  How to enhance cost efficiencies at the various stages of the peer review process?  How to develop an effective international frame of reference for expert review?  How to manage the conflicts of interest in the expert review process?  What opportunities does the Internet offer for improving expert review?  What type of expert review is fit for the evaluation of policy, programmes, or PROs?  What are the key principles for a high-quality programme/policy expert review? 6. The results of the review thus far are in line with the conclusions derived from the related literature and various national and international workshops. 1. First, despite problems in expert review including a hollowing-out due to time constraints, rising financial costs, and the risk of conflicts of interest among expert reviewers, the expert review process remains as a fundamental mechanism for all stages of research planning and implementation as well as for both ex ante project selection and for ex post evaluation.   2. Second, there are several ways to improve the expert review process, including: making the process more transparent, providing clear objectives and guidelines to reviewers, using different tools and using a variety of metrics and indicators. 3. Third, while indicators can strengthen and inform judgements, they cannot by themselves form judgements. Making judgement still requires careful consideration to prevent perverse outcomes. 4. Fourth, because of increased international collaboration in Science and Technology, there is a clear need to facilitate and improve the internationalisation of expert review. However, caution must be taken when policy is transferred across cultures and contexts, particularly when the understandings of policies are incomplete. Therefore, there is a need for taxonomy to help underpin the internationalisation of expert review. 5. Fifth, one size does not fit all and hence a much better understanding of the design requirements for expert review is needed. 6. Finally, a perfect evaluation system cannot exist; one must adapt the evaluation system to the environment. What was ideal in the past may no longer be effective in the future. This paper concludes with a list of principles and suggestions for good practices in the use of expert review in programme and policy evaluation that are based on findings from the literature on expert review and the experience of Members countries. These principles and suggestions include: 1. Relevant stakeholders should understand and agree upon the underlying philosophy, the focus, and future use of an evaluation.  High-level policy makers or evaluation managers should clearly define the roles of each actor in the evaluation process and regularly monitor performance.  Training should be provided prior to the evaluation.  Objective and useful criteria should be selected prior to the evaluation. 2. Qualified experts should be selected as evaluators.  In addition to technological experts, seek experts from diverse domains, including experts in social sciences and in economy.  Build a sufficiently large database of experts. 3. The risk of bias or conflict of interest among evaluators should be reduced as much as possible.  Provide a bias statement for reviewers so that experts declare their interests to ensure that the panel's reputation for fairness is upheld.  Guard against dysfunctional group dynamics.  Avoid internal evaluators.  Limit the number of evaluations or the duration of evaluations for the participating experts. 4. The review should be conducted in a credible, fair, transparent manner with the highest ethical standards.  Provide transparency in the evaluation process and in the evaluation results.    Maintain high ethical standards. 5. The review should be based on objective evidence and information.  Provide, in advance, sufficient information on the evaluated policy/programme to the evaluators.  When quantitative/qualitative indicators are used, test the validity and reliability of those indicators.  Encourage a maximum amount of dialogue and discussion. 6. One size does not fit all.  Complement expert review with quantitative methods to increase objectivity and scientific reliability of the evaluation.  Seek the type of expert review appropriate for the particular type of programme to be evaluated. 7. It is possible to increase the efficiency of evaluations through various measures.  Increase remote evaluation.  Build and operate evaluation management system through Internet-based technology.  Minimise the part of the evaluation cost born by the subject of the evaluation.  Design evaluation processes by paying attention to hidden indirect costs. 8. Improve design of expert panels  To ensure continuity, it is advisable to appoint someone who has participated in previous panels as the head of a panel.  It is advisable that one-third to one-half of a review panel be carried over from one review to the next in order to enhance new perspectives as well as continuity. 7. In conclusion, the demand for effective evaluation tools to inform decisions on research funding and impacts will continue to increase in line with additional public investments in Research and Development and innovation as countries try to enhance competitiveness and improve innovation capacity but also due to greater accountability and demands to improve the effectiveness of public support. Expert review remains a key tool for evaluation. However, policy makers and stakeholders form the research community must work together to enhance its effectiveness as a tool to shape research funding decisions and to assess the output and impacts of public investment in Research and Development and innovation at programme and policy level.	global challenges *** human resources *** research organisations *** funded research *** peer review *** funded research *** public investment in research *** evaluation tools *** research organisations *** peer review *** policy evaluations *** international collaboration *** evaluation systems *** good practices *** policy evaluations *** evaluation process *** evaluation process *** funded research *** public investment in research *** innovation capacity *** evaluation tools *** evaluation tools *** funded research *** public investment in research	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)5	OUTLINE OF THE FINAL REPORT ON EVALUATION TO THE CSTP : ENHANCING RESEARCH PERFORMANCE THROUGH EVALUATION AND PRIORITY SITTING	2008	R	1. Evaluation and priority setting in Research and Development policy has become an issue of major importance in OECD countries. The CSTP has requested its Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) to help countries develop a better understanding of the issues in designing and implementing their own evaluation practices and methods. The TIP has therefore proceeded to organise a project on evaluation of research and innovation policies looking at four main areas: i) the role of peer review as a tool in the evaluation of research and innovation policies, programmes and institutions; ii) the role of evaluation in priority setting and decision making; iii) the architecture or systems of evaluation in countries (see DSTI/STP/TIP (2007)15 and DSTI/STP/TIP (2008)1). An additional module on the internationalisation of evaluation has been mainstreamed into the other three modules. The TIP is carrying out this work in co-operation with the Working Group on Research Institutions and Human Resources [RIHR, formerly Steering and Funding of Research Institutions (SFRI)], which is focusing on evaluation issues surrounding public research organisations (PROs). The project also builds on TIP work on Assessing the Socio- Economic Impacts of Public Research and Development and work in NESTI on output indicators for Science and Technology. 2. Partly because the project on evaluation was designed in a modular approach, and partly because the OECD has a long history of work on evaluation, the TIP work has taken a rather narrow focus. The Secretariat therefore suggests taking a step back and recalling the role of evaluation in Science and Technology and its development in terms of theoretical and empirical foundations. Indeed, evaluation is an area of constant change as new tools emerge (e.g. microdata sources, large socio-economic datasets) and as theoretical underpinnings also evolve in response to changes in the way public Research and Development is financed and performed and to changes in the way innovation occurs (e.g. open science, multidisciplinary research, open innovation, globalisation). This new work will serve as the overall and introductory chapter of the final report. Furthermore, the Secretariat proposes that the final report also reflect findings from the related TIP project on Assessing the Socio-Economic Effects of Public Research and Development, insofar as it relates to the evaluation process itself, both as an element of evaluation (i.e. most evaluations of Research and Development programmes/ policies contain elements of impact assessment) but also as an overall determinant or guiding principle for evaluations, especially meta or macro evaluations (e.g. economy-wide returns).	priority setting *** evaluation systems *** peer review *** evaluation tools *** evaluation of research *** priority setting *** human resources *** research organisations *** research organisations *** economic impacts *** public research and development *** impacts of public research *** public research and development *** open science *** open innovation *** public research and development *** evaluation process *** development programmes *** impact assessment *** research performance	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)6	REPORT ON THE TIP WORKSHOP ON Research and Development TAX TREATMENT IN OECD COUNTRIES: COMPARISONS AND EVALUATIONS	2008	R	2. In 2007 some 21 OECD countries offered a tax credit for Research and Development, compared to 12 in 1995. Furthermore, the generosity of Research and Development tax incentives has tended to increase. It is therefore not surprising that OECD countries seek to better understand the efficiency, effectiveness and impacts of Research and Development tax incentives. The TIP workshop highlighted the diversity of Research and Development tax incentives in OECD countries in terms of their objectives, design and the results of evaluations. Still, a number of key messages emerged from the workshop: a. Tax incentives for Research and Development are on the rise and are becoming more generous. They are also becoming more differentiated by firm-size, with some countries focusing on incentives for chabadu chabados. Local governments in some countries are also active in offering tax incentives which can raise the overall generosity that a country offers in terms of fiscal relief for Research and Development. b. lt is important to understand the rationale and objectives for Research and Development tax incentives. Traditionally, the argument for tax incentives lies in its non-discriminatory nature and in its ease of use. From a policy perspective, the case for an Research and Development tax incentive is linked to potential market failures that reduce incentives for private Research and Development and prevent Research and Development investment from reaching socially optimal levels. In practice, the decision to offer an Research and Development tax incentive has become more complex and dependent not only on the policy objectives but also on its interaction with other instruments (i.e. the mix of policy instruments).   c. Choosing the right tax incentive for the right Research and Development policy goal. Governments face several choices in designing an Research and Development tax incentive. Should the scheme encourage Research and Development in all business firms with a uniform, market neutral instrument or should it focus on support to chabadu chabados as a way to address possible market failures in capital markets? Depending on the objectives, the design of the tax incentive must also consider the question of the tax base. There are significant differences across countries regarding the tax base, the costs covered and so forth. This will influence decisions on volume or incremental-based tax incentives. d. There is a need to move beyond the B-index of generosity and improve measures of actual costs. The B-index is a useful tool as it measures the attractiveness of the tax system and makes international comparisons possible. But in a rapidly changing environment where the design of incentives is changing, it is important to be able to compare the qualitative aspects of schemes and to assess actual generosity and costs, e.g. in terms of foregone tax revenue. e. Evaluating Research and Development tax incentives. Evaluation is necessary, in view of the rising reliance of innovation policy on the Research and Development tax credit, and in view of its rising cost to governments: in some countries, tax incentives are the main instrument for supporting business Research and Development. Many countries offer such schemes but in very diverse ways. Evaluations must be carried out in light of the goals set out and with regard to the costs. In this case, it is important to consider all possible costs involved (e.g. distortion of other taxes, compliance cost, etc.). f. Tax incentives are being used to stimulate innovation above and beyond business Research and Development. The fiscal system is also being used to foster innovation processes that impact on innovation but are not necessarily Research and Development based. These include fostering venture capital investments, especially in early stage ventures, entrepreneurship and collaboration between public research institutions/universities and firms. The interaction of these fiscal incentives with Research and Development tax incentives should also be considered. g. The risk of Research and Development tax competition is real but its impacts on the tax base have yet to be assessed. Participants raised the issue of the risk of tax competition between countries in order to attract (mobile) Research and Development investments and to expand the national tax base. The impact of such competition on the location of Research and Development and the tax base has not yet been assessed. Such impacts likely will depend on the broader tax policy issues in the countries (e.g. corporate tax rates, labour taxes, capital gains, wealth taxes) and the interactions with the tax base. 3. In conclusion, Research and Development tax incentives are increasingly used by OECD and non-OECD countries alike and their use continues to evolve. Many public policies compete for the use of fiscal relief to meet multiple economic and social policy objectives (e.g. tax incentives to boost low-skilled employment, tax incentives for venture capital). The relationship between tax incentives for Research and Development and innovation and broader tax policy goals to stimulate growth needs to be investigated and better understood.	tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** small and medium sized firms *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** research and development expenditures *** tax incentives *** market failures *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** policy instruments *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** small and medium sized firms *** market failures *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** innovation process *** venture capital *** research organisations *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** research and development expenditures *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** venture capital *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems	policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives

DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)10	PROPOSAL FOR FOLLOW-UP TIP WORK ON GOVERNANCE AND POLICY ROUNDTABLE	2009	R	1. As part of its 2009-2010 programme of work TIP agreed to carry out work in the area of STI governance. Although this activity is not funded in the part 1 budget allocation, Delegates agreed to pursue this issue on an ad hoc and voluntary basis. Governance remains an important issue in many OECD countries, despite recent initiatives to improve governance structures in countries such as Austria, Korea and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the issue of governance will be addressed in the OECD Innovation Strategy to be submitted to ministers in 2010. Following the December 2008 TIP workshop on the Innovation Strategy  Contributions from the Country Reviews and TIP activities [DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2008)2], it was suggested that the Secretariat develop an outline of the key issues that could be addressed in the context of a TIP Policy Roundtable in late 2009/early 2010 which could help provide guidance and recommendations in the area of STI governance. This paper presents these issues for discussion by TIP Delegates at their June 2009 meeting. Issues for TIP 2. There are several key drivers of change impacting upon the nature and performance of STI governance. Some of these are relatively specific to the STI area, for example, shifting ideas and expectations around the contributions of STI to socio-economic development, changes in the dynamics of science and innovation, and a renewed interest in coherence between supply and demand-side policies. Others are more generic and include globalisation, regionalisation, New Public Management (NPM), and an increased emphasis on Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) in the provision of public goods. Taken together, these drivers of change create several tensions and sometimes trade-offs in the governance of STI around, for example, the public and the private; top-down steering and more bottom-up self-organisation; horizontal and vertical coordination; multi-scalar governance arrangements; technocratic and democratic modes of governance; and consideration of the short-term and longer-term. 3. Rather than taking these tensions as a starting point, several practical headings are proposed as a basis for formulating new work on the topic of STI governance. These are as follows: 1. STI Governance for Addressing Societal Agendas 2. Implementation Gaps and Adaptive STI Governance 3. Autonomy and Accountability in STI Governance 4. Multi-Scalar Governance of STI 5. Horizontal Governance 6. Prioritisation 7. Future STI Governance 8. International Governance Each of these work headings is further elaborated below	governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** public private partnerships *** new public management *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)12	DRAFT OUTLINE OF THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY OUTLOOK 2010	2009	O	the Science, Technology and Industry Outlook 2010 will have three core chapters including country profiles across the OECD, and to the extent possible, accession and enhanced engagement countries. The first chapter will provide a general overview of main trends in science, technology and innovation over the past few years, drawing on available OECD statistical indicators and other material. The chapter Recent developments in science, technology, and innovation policy will examine the key policy actions that countries initiated in 2008-09 or that they anticipate implementing in 2009 and beyond, both with regard to the current economic and financial crisis as well as longer-term strategies. As in previous editions, the chapter will begin with a general overview of major changes in Science and Technology and innovation policies, and the institutional structures in which they take place (e.g. changes in Ministries responsible for science, technology and innovation policy). In keeping with enduring themes of recent DSTI work, the chapter will subsequently address policy developments related to the financing and governance of public sector research, government incentives for business Research and Development and innovation, industry-science linkages, and human resources for Science and Technology. Chapter 3 on country profiles will analyse a countrys performance in relation to its national context and current policy issues. It will also enable countries to see their strengths and weaknesses in light of other countries' performance. It will provide comparable and up-to-date rankings against the OECD average. Specific indicators and topics of interest that could be considered include: scientific and innovation outcomes; research and innovation inputs; linkages and networks, including international linkages; human resources; and financing innovation and the role of venture capital. will analyse a countrys performance in relation to its national context and current policy issues. It will also enable countries to see their strengths and weaknesses in light of other countries' performance. It will provide comparable and up-to-date rankings against the OECD average.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)14	PROGRESS REPORT TO CSTP AND RENEWAL OF TIP MANDATE	2009	M	Activity 21 : New forms of innovation: challenges for policymaking : theoretical framework and a brief literature review on the topic. questionnaire for the policy inventory was sent out at the beginning of September. An expert meeting to discuss the preliminary results of the policy inventory, to update the country case studies and to identify the main policy messages. Activity 22 : Evaluation and impact assessment : The Steering Group organised a break-out session at the June TIP meeting in co- operation with the European Commission OMC-Net on Impact Assessment. the TIP agreed on three avenues for further work: the development of a typology of forms of research evaluation; capacity building in impact assessment including developing tools for evaluation in collaboration with the OMC-Net group; and work with NESTI on improving indicators for impact assessment. Activity 2.3 Adjusting to globalisation of innovation : The Steering Group organised a break-out session at the last TIP meeting on the question of International Research and Development and Innovation Spill-overs. A scoping paper was presented on the types of spill-overs and their impacts.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)15	NEW FORMS OF INNOVATION: INTERIM DRAFT REPORT AND KEY MESSAGES TO THE INNOVATION STRATEGY	2009	R	Innovation shapes and is being shaped by globalisation, the development of the Internet and todays global challenges, notably environmental sustainability. Together with a broad range of other factors these major trends have contributed to the emergence of what can be termed new forms of innovation (NFI) involving a wide range of new actors responding to new incentives, challenges and opportunities. What characterises these new forms and why is this important for policy makers? These are the questions the TIP has sought to answer through the project on New Forms of Innovation. This paper presents the main findings from the project in mid-course in order to provide some key messages to the OECD Innovation Strategy. The OECD has long espoused a broad notion of innovation both conceptually and in terms of statistical measurement as illustrated by the successive revisions to the Oslo Manual. And while novelty is a given in innovation, it is apparent that several forms of innovations, some of which were previously marginal such as user-driven innovation, are increasing in importance. Other innovations related to business methods, design, and organisational innovations that may or may not involve technology are being applied in new markets, new contexts, and potentially challenging existing policy frameworks. The question for policy makers is whether the changes in the nature and shape of innovation alter the rationale for policy intervention? And if so, what types of adjustments to incentive structures and policies may be needed? Can existing policies support new modes of innovation in firms but also elsewhere, including in the public and private non-profit sectors where the potential for innovation remains untapped? Or are different policies needed for different forms of innovation? To take stock of these new forms and the implications for policy, the TIP project has developed the following taxonomy of approaches to assess novelty in innovation:  The output-based approach, which looks at the type of innovation introduced (Science and Technology based or based on business methods, organisational and design driven innovations).  The behaviour-based approach, which looks at the varied and new forms of collaboration from user-driven innovation to new international partnerships for Research and Development.  And the challenge-driven approach which identifies social and environmental challenges as new drivers of innovation. The three approaches do not identify excluding categories; they represent three different ways of analysing novelty in innovation, each focusing on a different aspect: the type of innovation; the way through which innovation is organised, and the rationale for innovation policy interventions. If there is nothing really new under the sun in terms of the definitions of innovation, the three approaches help to clarify that there is increasing complexity and variety in innovation and that firms, users and institutions are experimenting new models and new strategies for innovation. Those issues (complexity, variety, novelty and experimentation) challenge the design and implementation of traditional innovation policies. In particular, the NFI concept widens the domains for innovation policies and requires institutional arrangements and management which go beyond the domain of action of Science and Technology ministries.   Results from the TIP policy inventory collected by the TIP Steering Group on NFI confirm the hypothesis that innovation is increasingly characterised by a variety of new forms and new traits which are being reflected in the design of new policies to support innovation. These policies can be categorised into five major classes: i) Policies targeting Science and Technology agents (Research and Development intensive firms, universities, research labs) which are the traditional policies, but which incorporate new elements or mechanisms such as public procurement and policies to support demand for innovation. This is also evident in the policies to address the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation and policies to support different forms of collaboration for innovation (e.g. policies supporting cross-border research or public private partnerships). ii) Policies targeting creative agents (firms, institutions, individuals and groups/communities) which innovate in the domain of organisational, business and design driven innovations (e.g. policies supporting innovation in design or multidisciplinary training). iii) Policies targeting the scientific commons, which encourage knowledge sharing and circulation through new physical and virtual platforms for interaction of a high number of stakeholders (e.g. user-drive innovation). iv) Policies supporting the creative commons, which identify interactions between different agents who innovate in design, business models and organisations structures (e.g. public sector innovation). v) Policies targeting social and environmental challenges as a goal of new innovation policies. Such challenge-oriented policies generally require a combination of the four different previously mentioned types of policies and involve new modes of governance and collaboration within government but with industry, NGOs and users/consumers. Although work on new forms of innovation is still underway and although the experience of OECD and emerging economies is quite diverse, a few messages are emerging:  A broader notion of innovation has entered the mainstream policy discourse. Countries are experimenting with new polices to support innovation beyond the traditional forms of innovation (i.e. technology-based innovation), in particular non-technological innovations, design driven innovations.  The open innovation model has also recast traditional policies to promote collaboration between science and industry in a new light, not just through traditional schemes to foster research partnerships and consortia between universities and firms but also collaboration between users, consumers and external agents.  Innovation has become more pervasive and is being mobilised to contribute to both economic goals and social well-being. At all levels of policy, health, social challenges and environmental challenges have become key priorities for innovation. This challenge driven focus of innovation has given rise to new instruments and institutional arrangements but also to new challenges in terms of policy governance.  Countries are shifting from a supply-side and technology push towards a more integrated  approach  which  looks  at  demand  (different  types  of  demand: public   procurement; and new mechanisms such as the role of citizens in policy-shaping and the role of users and consumers).  Innovation in the public sector and innovation in the delivery of public services is a topic of rising relevance on the innovation agenda.  Countries are experimenting with new types of innovation policies. There is a shift towards participatory policies; (new platforms to allow stake-holders participation in policy design; new modes for increasing citizens engagement and user participation in policy design).  The capacity of policy makers to develop and implement new policies for the new forms of innovation will also depend on expanding the evidence base, including through the creative use of existing innovation indicators and the development of additional indicators to design and evaluate policy interventions. As the TIP project moves forward in 2010, notably through the case studies and further exploitation of the policy inventory, it is expected that these messages will be fine-tuned to provide more practical guidance to countries as they develop policies to promote innovation in its myriad forms.	environmental sustainability *** global challenges *** new actors *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** organisational innovations *** policy frameworks *** policy interventions *** incentive structures *** innovative firms *** new modes *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** environmental problems *** policy interventions *** business models *** institutional arrangements *** support innovation *** new forms of innovation *** public procurement *** globalisation of research *** public private partnerships *** support innovation *** business models *** public sector *** environmental problems *** new modes *** new forms of innovation *** support innovation *** model of innovation *** open innovation *** environmental problems *** institutional arrangements *** public sector *** new modes *** new forms of innovation *** policy interventions *** new forms of innovation	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)16	Recent Trends in the Globalisation of Research and Development and Innovation : Briefing Note	2009	R	1. The past quarter century has witnessed what economic historians call the third wave of globalisation in modern times. In contrast to the preceding waves of the late 19th and post-war period of the 20th century which were characterised by the ebb and flow of managed trade relations, the recent phase was characterised by the rapid integration of the world economies due to the multilateral liberalisation of trade and unprecedented advancements in technology, communications, science, transport and industry. 2. The process of globalisation has helped raise living standards in OECD countries and emerging economies--such as the BRICs  which were able to build the capacity to develop platforms to participate and draw benefits from multilateral trading system1. Science, technology and innovation have been both a catalyst for globalisation but are have also been shaped by it. For example, the splitting of vertical production value chains across borders has also created opportunities for Research and Development and innovation to become globalised at a rapid pace. Increasing mobility of researchers and skilled workers have helped spread tacit flows of knowledge, drawn by new hotspots of innovation around clusters of knowledge-based institutions and firms. Indeed, the internationalisation of Research and Development has fed the globalisation of innovation and vice-versa. 3. As the OECD countries continue on the path of economic recovery from the recent financial and economic crisis, this note presents a brief review of recent trends in the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation drawing on available OECD data and statistics. It is meant to support the ongoing TIP project on Adjusting Policies to the Globalisation of Research and Development and Innovation and provide some context for the discussion on the recent policy responses to globalisation identified via the policy questionnaire distributed by the TIP Steering Group on Globalisation. 6. Despite the recent shock to globalisation via the trade and FDI mechanisms, the available data show that the structural and underlying basis for the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation remain relatively strong. However, the rise of new players and the extension of players into new emerging markets may cause further changes in the direction of Research and Development and innovation flows. These qualitative changes have implications for countries seeking to capture spillovers from global innovation networks and boost national competiveness. At the same time, the current crisis and recovery phase provide an opportunity for policy makers to leverage science, technology and innovation as a constructive force in the coming fourth wave of globalisation which will have to tackle the challenge of climate and the greening of global value chains.  In this way, globalisation of Research and Development and innovation should not only contribute to competitiveness but also to achieving sustainable economic growth	globalisation process *** value chains *** knowledge flows *** globalisation of innovation *** internationalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** global innovation networks *** global value chains *** economic growth *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research	internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)17	STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS FOR TIP_S PROGRAMME OF WORK 2011-2012	2009	M	it is highly probable that the following areas for work will be a priority for the OECD and the CSTP: Follow-up to the OECD Innovation Strategy, Green Growth Strategy, International co-operation on Science, Technology and Innovation, Enabling innovation through converging technologies. Possible elements of the PWB in 2011-2012. Theme 1: Redefining the relationship between science, technology, innovation and growth. The economic crisis and longer-term global challenges will have lasting effects on the organisation of national systems for science, technology and innovation. New targets will be set (such as for green growth) and the role of societal actors in determining the functioning of the  STI enterprise will grow. This will have important effects on the organisation of research, technology and innovation activities and their goals (i.e. competitiveness, green growth, social and global challenges) as well as the infrastructures (e.g. which capitalise on knowledge productivity in clusters and platforms for open innovation, and on self-reinforcing mechanisms of increasing returns) that underpin that organisation. Theme 2: The expansion of NIS-analysis to the global economy characterised by a multi-polar world faced with global challenges, but also opportunities. What are the conditions to allow an international innovation system to be built that provides for knowledge and technology flows but that generates returns to national investors. How might industry-science relations, and the  policies that underpin these, need to develop? Theme 3: Chabada chabado and Policies for the Demand-Supply Chain: The NIS  framework has long recognised the need to align supply with demand through greater interactions among innovation agents and stakeholders, including government, consumers and users. But it has treated the formation of supply as distinct from the development of demand. However, the closer interaction of the two as well as the increasing number of variables on the demand- side (technological trajectories, changing regulations, dynamic standards, changing consumer preferences) and on the supply-side (fluctuations in Research and Development, changes in human capital flows and  the skills mix) make the matching of supply and demand more complex and challenging at all levels of policy making. This is especially a problem as the shift to green growth will require systemic adjustments in production and supply models.  Theme 4: Policy frameworks and technology convergence: The stock of technology continues to increase in OECD members and non-members. However, its broader application, especially to sectors outside its initial application may be hampered by market dynamics, technology lock-in, government policies and regulations (e.g. the case of e-health). Yet many contributions of technology to productivity could be realised if convergence could be facilitated.	green growth *** international co-operation *** innovation and growth *** global challenges *** green growth *** research organisations *** innovation activities *** green growth *** global challenges *** open innovation *** global challenges *** global economy *** technological knowledge *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** green growth *** policy frameworks	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** internationalisation_globalisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)18	OPTIMISING THE POLICY MIX BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON METHODOLOGY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF (SOCIO-) ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF RTDI PUBLIC FUNDING	2009	R	74. Based on the insights and evidence presented on impact assessment practices in Europe, we note an increased use of impact assessment in policy making towards RTDI. However in most countries the planning of impact assessment at the policy cycle is still on an ad hoc or exceptional base. Moreover, in some countries it is administration or agency dependent. Also, despite the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, still little attention is paid to broader societal impacts of public funding for RTDI. 75. Several reasons can be put forward why impact assessment exercises of public funding for RTDI are not easy to perform. First, even when considering only three clusters of RTDI policies (the enhancement of private RTDI; the enhancement of industry-science cooperation; and the improvement and governance of public research), most of the studies envisage different policy areas at the same time. Second, there seems to be a problem to find appropriate indicators to measure the different impacts (scientific, technologic, economic, and societal) of public funding for RTDI. The appropriability of indicators seems to be case dependent and especially societal impacts turn out difficult to measure. This finding is probably - at least to some extent - related to the fact that only half of the projects considered indicators for impact assessment at the set-up of the policy programme/measure. Therefore, progressing in the usage of appropriate indicators for measuring the socio-economic impact helps to progress in the formulation of the model logic for intervention. Moreover, this will enhance the usefulness of impact assessment as a tool for policy makers since policy making still largely is evidence-based (e.g. the Lisbon strategy). Some hampering factors for the usefulness of impact assessment as a tool for policy making have been identified. First, in impact assessment the focus remains on outputs, outcomes, impacts, goal attainment, and additionality. But, too little attention is paid to policy/strategy development and project implementation efficiency. This means that the policy cycle is not closed. This can be related to the fact that in less than half of the impact assessment studies ordered by government administrations/agencies, politicians and the programme management is involved. This confirms the existence of a gap between policy formulation and implementation. Also there seems to be relatively low involvement of those directly or potentially supported by the measure. Related to this finding, when it comes to wider discussion of the analysis and recommendations, it turned out that quite often government and participants or stakeholders were not involved. Finally, concerning the formulation of recommendations based on the impact assessment exercises, the focus mainly is at the re-design, expansion or management of a programme/measure. Broader policy design is not an objective in over half of the impact assessment exercises and the influence and relation with other policy measures (e.g. in terms of re-design or merger) are limited. This reveals little attention to the broader policy mix in impact assessment exercises.	impact assessment *** policy cycle *** impact assessment *** impact assessment *** public research *** policy areas *** impact assessment *** policy profiles *** impact assessment *** policy profiles *** impact assessment *** impact assessment *** development strategies *** policy cycle *** impact assessment *** policy formulation *** impact assessment *** impact assessment *** policy measures *** impact assessment *** policy mix *** economic impacts *** policy mix	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)2	The OECD Innovation Strategy and the OECD Strategic Response to the Financial and Economic Crisis: Implications for TIP	2009	R	1. The OECD has just released the 2009 Interim Report of the Innovation Strategy, in response to a Ministerial request at the May 2007 Ministerial Council Meeting to address countries needs for a more comprehensive, coherent and timely understanding of how to promote, measure and assess innovation and its underlying dynamics of change. The Strategy will deliver a set of overarching principles to guide innovation policy in the 21st century. 2. At the same time, the OECD has also released a series of reports following on its Strategic Response to the Financial and Economic Crisis which provide recommendations on the strategies for aligning stimulus measures with long-term growth in order to achieve green and stronger growth. Policies geared to innovation, and more broadly, policies which impact on innovation outcomes feature prominently in both of these reports. Indeed, in the response to the crisis, many of the recommendations place an emphasis on counter-cyclical investments in Research and Development and innovation as well as in related infrastructure, including ICT infrastructure.	research investments	policy_area_public_research

DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)5/REV1	ENHANCING PUBLIC RESEARCH PERFORMANCE THROUGH EVALUATION, IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PRIORITY SETTING	2009	R	1. Evaluation of publicly funded research has become a central concern of policy makers for two main reasons. First, there is growing demand for evidence-based policies and for evaluation of the results of public investments. More precisely, governments increasingly seek to determine how much they should invest in science and technology (Science and Technology), research and development (Research and Development), and innovation. They wish to know where to invest and what society gets in return. Ideally, evaluation should help determine the economic effects of both public investment in Research and Development and innovation and the social impacts. Policy makers also increasingly want public investment to help meet global challenges, such as energy, security and climate change. 2. Second, the demand for evaluation has expanded because OECD countries have substantially increased public investment in Research and Development despite budget constraints. Governments not only finance Research and Development in various sectors of performance such as the business sector or the higher education sector, they also fund the performance of Research and Development on their own behalf. Government budget appropriations or outlays for Research and Development (GBAORD) measures the funds committed by federal/central governments for Research and Development. In aggregate, these have been climbing faster than GDP across the OECD, by 6.4% annually since 2001. In addition to direct support, governments also finance business Research and Development indirectly through the use of tax incentives. Although they may be significant, the costs of these tax credits, in terms of foregone revenue, do not usually appear as Research and Development support in government budgets. 3. The demand for effective evaluation tools to inform decisions on research funding and impacts will continue to increase in line with public investment in Research and Development and innovation as countries try to enhance competitiveness and improve innovation capacity. The need for evaluation is also likely to increase because of demands for greater accountability and effectiveness. Evaluation assists governments in their decisions to prioritise resources for Research and Development and innovation and can help them design research programmes. Moreover, it enhances public accountability, creates a better-informed society, and raises awareness of the contribution of research to a countrys economic and social development. The demand for evaluation is also changing owing to increased interest in evaluating entire research systems and research portfolios. This greater emphasis on evaluation, however, has raised a number of important conceptual and methodological challenges. 4. The report has two parts. Part I (Chapters 1 to 4) first sets the stage by discussing key issues in the evaluation of public science and technology research performance. It presenting evaluation as a means of addressing both the demand for accountability on the part of various stakeholders and the need to consider the public value of such research. The report next discusses three specific evaluation contexts: i) expert reviews, ii) impact assessments, and iii) priority-setting activities. The first two deal more specifically with the evaluation of research programmes, projects and policies. The third demonstrates another possible area for the application of evaluation processes. 5. Chapter 1 presents key issues in the evaluation of Science and Technology and sets the stage for addressing specific topics in more detail: the architecture of evaluation systems insofar as they exist, peer review as a tool for evaluation, and the interplay between evaluation and priority setting. It begins by recalling the emergence of evaluation of public research, from its initial focus on improving the quality of research by evaluating discrete outcomes of research (e.g. publications) to more complex attempts to evaluate the economic and   non-economic social effects of research as well as environment/ecology/systemic effects. It discusses diverse approaches to evaluation, most of which use economic frameworks. While these have many advantages, they have limitations, particularly in relation to the impact of research on social change. Evaluation is considered from the various perspectives of governments, civil society, research institutions, funding agencies, evaluators and social scientists. Finally, the chapter draws on recent history to assess the social impacts of research and describes new theoretical and empirical efforts (e.g. the science of science policy). 6. Chapter 2 assesses the role of expert reviews  a broader type of peer review  in shaping funding decisions (e.g. what, who and where to fund research) and in evaluating the output and impacts of public investment in Research and Development and innovation. Expert review is one of the methods most commonly used to evaluate public funding of Science and Technology. Although it has many merits, including low cost and easy applicability, it currently faces its strongest challenges in several decades. Externally, there is some evidence that political decision makers question how well any type of peer review can address socioeconomic and political priorities. Internally, there is evidence of hollowing out as increasing pressures on researchers time make it more difficult to find experts willing to undertake reviews. 7. Chapter 3 presents findings of the TIP Impact Assessment project that relate to the rationale, methods and tools for evaluating public Research and Development at country or economy level and at the institutional and programme levels. It discusses key methodological challenges and suggests ways to improve impact assessments based on country experiences. 8. Chapter 4 analyses priority setting and the role of evaluation in designing policy. Priority setting is the conscious selection of activities at the expense of others. It affects resource allocation. Here, priority setting differs from the type of priority setting that takes place in a self-organising system. Priority setting and evaluation are two distinct issues. The priority-setting process has several dimensions, the importance of which varies over time. The chapter examines, in particular, the links between ex ante and ex post evaluation in priority setting and decision making and seeks to identify best practices for improving both the quality of ex ante evaluations and their usefulness in the policy-making process, notably in priority setting. It also assesses the process of priority setting in Science and Technology itself and identifies structural weaknesses as well as best practices. 9. Part II presents six case studies of systems for evaluating Science and Technology programmes, projects and policies in China (Chapter 5), Finland (Chapter 6), Israel (Chapter 7), Norway (Chapter 8), Japan (Chapter 9) and Austria (Chapter 10). The case studies are organised so as to give the reader first the feel of a broader assessment of national evaluation systems before dealing with specific issues of evaluation methodology, processes, and scope and some current problems. The case studies are varied with regard to the comprehensiveness of the evaluation systems, the objectives of evaluations, and how they are conducted and used for policy making. Many of the issues discussed in previous chapters are addressed in the case studies. 10. The case studies show that in all countries, the rationale for evaluation is to improve Research and Development performance and to ensure efficient use of the natural and monetary resources invested. The roles of ministries differ, however, among the countries. While ministries play an active role in Japan and China, evaluation is delegated to research councils or other funding bodies in the other countries. In several countries, evaluation is also grounded in legal frameworks and regulations at the national government, funding agency or research council level. 11. The case studies illustrate differences in the comprehensiveness of evaluation systems, the objectives of evaluations, and the way they are conducted and used for policy making. In particular, they map institutional frameworks, actors, regulations and practices for designing and implementing evaluations   (ex ante or ex post) in the area of Science and Technology. Some case studies also offer suggestions or guidelines for improving the current system. For all six countries, the rationale for evaluation is to improve Research and Development performance and to ensure efficient use of the resources invested. The roles of ministries differ and the evaluation mechanisms and tools adopted also differ depending on the level of evaluation and country- specific factors. However, addressing social and economic impacts remains a challenge for most countries, mainly owing to the difficulty of attributing impact to a specific research programme, particularly after a lapse of several years. Scientific impact is easier to measure than social impact, and the impact of applied research is more easily measured than that of basic research. The outcomes of evaluations appear to have the greatest influence on improving the design, implementation and effectiveness of programmes, and a more limited impact on policy decisions for funding, with the exception of evaluations of basic research programmes. 12. The key messages of this report can be summarised as follows:  There is growing demand for evaluation of Science and Technology. Demand for evaluation is increasing and changing from evaluating the quality of research (via peer review) to assessing the outcome, output and impact of public Research and Development. There is also increasing interest in evaluating entire research systems and research portfolios and in enhancing the role of evaluation as a tool for priority setting and decision making.  The peer review process remains a fundamental mechanism for research planning, implementation and evaluation. Peer review is under stress, but solutions exist (e.g. extended peer review processes involving non-scientific stakeholders; combing metrics and indicators). There is a need to facilitate and improve the internationalisation of peer review because of the increase in international research collaboration.  Evaluation of social/economic impacts requires new metrics and approaches. In addition to new indicators and methodologies, assessing social/economic impacts requires stakeholder involvement as well as new communication channels (to decision makers, to agents, to stakeholders). Impact assessment must also balance the tension between (scientific) relevance and social/economic impacts.  Evaluation capacity remains weak and fragmented. Evaluation is functionally fragmented in many countries, but elements of a system appear to be in place. These elements include a clear role for outside evaluators and stakeholders outside research establishments, the importance of setting standards in evaluation, and the role of self-evaluation. A system of evaluation also requires establishing follow-up processes on the consequences of evaluations.  Evaluation can no longer be done solely in a national perspective. International comparisons are increasingly used in national policy analysis (e.g. FP7 participation rankings, University of Shanghai rankings). International benchmarks are necessary for public policy evaluations, especially in areas in which countries compete with others.  Usefulness of evaluation for policy making varies but is often limited. Evaluations can be used for improving project management as well as for strategy. The use of feedback from evaluations can be constrained by a lack of data, negative findings or a lack of political buy-in by the leadership.  Priority setting and evaluation interact but remain distinct dimensions of policy making. Priority setting is a more complex exercise, involving a broader range of actors (e.g. funding agencies) and relying on different approaches and methodologies. This increases the need for mechanisms to ensure greater coherence between priority setting and policy making.    The conceptual underpinning of priority setting remains quite weak and expert opinion continues to predominate. Improving the process of priority setting through the use of ex ante evaluations requires political buy-in, commitment to invest in resources and develop skills, and the creation of indicators and data to monitor policy or programme effectiveness.  Impact assessment is part and parcel of evaluation. The rationale for impact assessment is becoming clearer as are policy needs for assessing the impacts of strategic research undertaken outside the context of mainstream public research in universities and government labs.  Measuring impacts is neither straightforward nor easy especially as regards demonstrating causality. Many of the dimensions through which Science and Technology affects society (e.g. societal, cultural or environmental impacts) are not easily captured by existing national statistical frameworks, as they are difficult to measure or evaluate. This makes it difficult to link social impacts to policy interventions. Nevertheless, methodological difficulties should not stand in the way of efforts to measure economic impacts.  The choice of methodology is context-specific. Impact assessment methodologies are not universally applicable, but depend on the objective of the impact assessment exercise, its timing (ex ante and/or ex post); and the scope and nature of Research and Development.  New and useful practices are being developed but methodological issues and (international) comparability remain challenges. The various methodologies are still evolving, but none of the available techniques has been able to capture the full range of the impacts of public Research and Development on society.  The international community and the OECD in particular can play a role in diffusing good practices and stimulating policy learning. Evaluation is an increasing challenge, not only in technical and methodological terms, but also in terms of the political challenges. International co- operation can help improve countries ability to effectively develop and foster the use of ex ante and ex post evaluation for research and innovation policy.	funded research ***

DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)6	NEW FORMS OF INNOVATION: CHALLENGES FOR POLICY MAKING	2009	R	1. It is increasingly recognised that innovation is much more than simply the development of a new technology and that successful innovation requires more than sustained investments in Research and Development. It is also clear that innovation involves a growing and diverse set of stakeholders and institutions. Innovation is also more interdisciplinary and is carried out through a variety of collaborative and co-operative arrangements. The economic rents from innovation are also being appropriated through a variety of new mechanisms. These characteristics of the innovation process, although not novel in a strict sense, are becoming more widespread and potentially challenge current policies and the institutional set up for policy design and implementation. 2. The challenge for OECD countries is first to understand how innovation is taking place today and what should be the role of government in this new context. For example, are there new forms of innovation that could positively impact productivity and growth or social demand but which remain over- looked or under appreciated by policy makers? Who are the new actors and stakeholders and what role do they play in shaping innovation? 3. This paper reviews the debate on new forms of innovation (NFI) from an objective stand-point. Indeed to some observers, there is nothing new under the sun while to others the devil is in the details, that is the changing context for innovation (e.g. globalisation, convergence of science, etc.) require responses and create incentives for new forms and new actors to emerge. 4. The first section briefly reviews the factors which are redefining the context in which innovation takes place and which shape innovation. The second section presents a review of the literature. The third section introduces a tentative taxonomy of different approaches for defining NFI.; it identifies three approaches to define the new forms of innovation:  The output-based approach, looks at the results of innovation, i.e. the type of innovation introduced by innovating firms (technological- process and product; and non technological  organisational and marketing, as defined by the Oslo Manual, and the relationship between them).  The behaviour-based approach (new collaborative arrangements for innovation). This strand of thinking identifies NFI according to the new ways of organising the process of innovation. The focus is on the ways in which innovation agents interact and chance behaviour to innovate.  The challenge-driven approach (innovation to address social challenges). The third approach considers innovation by its objectives, in particular to address specific challenges be they social, community-based or global. It starts from the recognition that contemporary societies are undergoing a shift in production and consumption priorities pushed by issues such as climate change, the sustainability of production, persistent inequality and poverty to name a few. 5. The fourth section raises some initial policy questions in relation with the various types of NFI. The fifth section addresses measurement challenges and suggests avenues for collaboration with the NESTI work on defining and measuring modes of innovation. The final section concludes and presents the next steps for TIP activity on new forms of innovation including possible work on case studies and a policy inventory of new policies or approaches to foster innovation.	research investments *** new technologies *** innovation process *** new forms of innovation *** new actors *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** new actors *** new forms of innovation *** innovation process *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2009)7	Research and Development AND INNOVATION SPILLOVERS: A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE	2009	R	4. The Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) has a long standing interest in the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation.2 In 2005, following a request by the CSTP, the TIP carried out a project on the Internationalisation of Business Research and Development which focused on the evidence and drivers of the globalisation of Research and Development and identified some of the policy implications. A follow-up project in TIP on Open Innovation in Global Networks linked the globalisation of the Research and Development function in firms and public research institutions with the opening up of the innovation process more broadly, including across global value chains. The results of both projects shed light on process of the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation with two major policy messages. First, that openness matters in both Research and Development and innovation and that policies  that promote openness in trade, Research and Development related FDI, technology, talent, and ideas should be pursued. In this respect, framework conditions, including INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs, were considered essential. A second message that emerged was the importance of the public research base and the education system in training talent and generating knowledge that could enhance the attractiveness of a country as a base of the location of high value and knowledge intensive activities. 5. However there were several policy issues that were left unanswered. First, if innovation policies could no longer be carried out in solely in a national context, there remain questions as to how to design policies that, while promoting openness, can ensure benefits flow back to national taxpayers and stakeholders. Countries from France to Sweden, while encouraging outward and inward FDI are concerned that national firms are expanding their Research and Development abroad while foreign firms in their countries are investing in existing firms for market access but not doing so in leading edge Research and Development and innovation activities nor are they partnering with national suppliers or public research organisations, limiting spillovers. Furthermore, while framework conditions and public research capacity matter for attractiveness of national economies, it is not altogether clear that these are sufficient conditions. Markets for knowledge, demand-side conditions such as user-driven innovation may also play a role in the attractiveness of countries for Research and Development and innovation activities. 6. Meanwhile, the current financial and economic crisis has again brought to the fore the question of how the benefits of the globalisation process are distributed both within and between countries. The recent collapse in global trade also raises questions as to the sustainability of global value chains and the knowledge embodied in networks of firms. In this context, the TIP has now embarked on a two-year activity on Adjusting Policies to the Globalisation of Innovation (DST/STP/TIP (2008)14). 7. The aim of this activity is to build on earlier work on the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation and to identify recommendations for helping adapt national STI policies in order to help countries to benefit more from the global flows of knowledge. Central to this goal is to understand how knowledge spill-overs arise from the processes of Research and Development and innovation locally, nationally and internationally. In addition, another gap that needs to be filled is to understand what shapes the direction of knowledge spill- overs; how the appropriation of spillovers or lack thereof of, impacts on innovation performance; the costs and benefits of spill-overs and understanding how these are influenced by public policy. 8. This first paper in the project reviews the existing literature on spill-overs arising from Research and Development and innovation as well as available measures. It proposes a taxonomy of spill-overs based on the literature and outlines a series of issues/questions for further research.	business research and development *** globalisation of research *** innovation process *** globalisation of research *** global value chains *** open innovation *** research organisations *** globalisation of research *** globalisation process *** framework conditions *** intellectual property *** research base *** public research *** knowledge intensive services *** foreign firms *** research organisations *** innovation activities *** public research *** framework conditions *** innovation activities *** globalisation process *** global value chains *** globalisation of innovation *** knowledge flows *** globalisation of research *** innovation performance	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)13	New Forms of Innovation: Draft Synthesis and Outline of the Final Report	2010	R	1. Innovation policies have historically assumed a model of innovation based on the following assumptions: 1) breakthroughs in products, process and services, and therefore significant growth and improvements in productivity, are generated mainly by investments in scientific and technological research; 2) this type of research mainly occusr in laboratories that are impermeable to exchange of knowledge and information with outsiders; 3) research in those laboratory is driven by the epistemological dynamics of scientists and engineers. 2. In an early phase this process was assumed to be science driven, i.e. scientists and public research were assumed to be the main players. In other words the model was of a linear supply-side type and science driven. 3. In subsequent years the innovation policy model evolved towards a competition-driven approach, alongside with the rising perception that innovation was a competition driven phenomena more than the result of scientific discoveries. The comprehension of the dynamics of innovation evolved and focused mainly on the private sector. The second generation of policies mainly assumed a model of innovation in which: 1) firms were the main innovative agents; 2) those agents followed different innovation strategies combining the use of internal and external resources for research and development; 3) research was driven by competition, and innovations were mainly product and process improvements enabled by technical advances. In other words, innovation was mainly technology push. 4. In the last decade several attempts have been made to advance in innovation policy design to better grasp the nature of innovation. The model of innovation evolved towards the concept of national innovation systems and policies tried to capture the networked and systemic dimension of innovation. Policies experimented several (almost too many) forms of supporting collaborations for innovation, especially focusing on Research and Development and technological developments. However, policies kept focusing on the scientific and technological dimensions, and fell short in adapting to a changing reality in which new forms of innovation emerge. 5. By New Forms of Innovation (NFI) we consider innovations that have significant impact on business dynamics and productivity and that do not totally comply with the above models, i.e., they are not only based on technology, not only occurring within the walls of laboratories, public or private, and not only following the dynamics of technology roadmaps and substitutions. 6. NFI are a phenomenon of rising relevance. Although figures about their diffusion and impact are still scarce (especially because the analysis of their relevance implies the development of new metrics), it clearly emerges that these new forms of innovation are reshaping the business dynamics of entire industries (from telecommunications to more traditional sectors like fashion, food and beverages industries). NFI are influencing not only the innovation process in several industries, but they are challenging current organizational models and they are requiring new competences and new organizational models in several firms. 7. The purpose of the report is to open the black box of NIF, better identify them and discuss the implications for innovation policies, in terms of: which new policy frameworks are enabled and/or required by the new dynamics of innovation, what is their relationship with traditional forms of support to innovation, and which governance challenges have to be faced in order to make innovation policies more effective.	model of innovation *** public research *** scientific discoveries *** private sector *** model of innovation *** model of innovation *** national innovation systems *** technology development *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** new forms of innovation *** innovation process *** policy frameworks *** new forms of innovation	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)14	ADJUSTING STI POLICIES TO THE GLOBALISATION OF Research and Development AND INNOVATION	2010	R	59. The emergence of a new players and a more multi-polar landscape for Research and Development and innovation, while offering opportunities to OECD countries, has raised concerns about a transfer or loss of capacity in OECD countries (e.g. loss of researchers jobs resulting from outsourcing or a decline in the relative wages of researchers) or whether globalisation can result in a win-win strategy in which the increasing returns from Research and Development abroad contributes to maintain or increase higher value research and innovation activities in the   home country. Clearly, ensuring the latter will require greater coherence in policy making across government ministries and departments to increase the leverage of existing mechanisms. A case in point is the links between investment promotion and immigration of investors and highly skilled personnel. Similarly, coherence between framework conditions on business entry and new firm creation as well as entrepreneurship will be needed. 60. A related challenge for governments is designing policy instruments for linking supply and demand for global knowledge (e.g. Public Private Partnerships, clusters, technology platforms) that on the one hand are open to foreign-based firms, but at the same time generate benefits to the local economy. These kinds of measures are best pursued along technology/sectoral lines that build on strengths and STI specialisation of the host country and strong links with global innovation networks. This may require targeting Research and Development and innovation support to the absorptive capacity of chabadu chabados. 61. In this context, the management of intellectual property rights is extremely important. While strong IP protection is important for rewarding inventors and attracting Research and Development-related FDI, excessively strong protection can act as a barrier to open innovation strategies that rely on knowledge sharing and access, especially with public research institutions 62. Another challenge for governments is governance, notably co-ordination of regional and national STI policies be it in areas of investment promotion, immigration, tax incentives or higher education policies or local employment policies. For example, offering tax incentives for Research and Development may not be sufficient if a region or country has poor collaboration between industry and universities. 63. While coherence and co-ordination are important, in practice, policies must also be differentiated given the differentiated nature of globalisation and differences in regional economies. Regions or smaller economies with a weak research base will need to focus on strengthening their knowledge capabilities in order to contribute to and participate in global innovation networks. ICT policies for example might also be reinforced both in terms of providing the infrastructure for global communication and research but also for enabling geographically located firms and public research organisations to take part in the global innovation networks. In countries where multinationals play a large role, the focus may need to be on removing barriers or creating incentives to allow local firms capture spillovers from global innovation networks. 64. For developing countries, the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation also carries risks and opportunities. The global production strategies of multinationals with a focus on low cost manufacturing and services may divert public and private resources from higher education or it may lead to a low-tech lock-in in terms of production and human capital specialisation. Lack of absorptive capacity or a mismatch between the types of Research and Development performed via FDI and the market needs of emerging economies can also limit the benefits for emerging economies. But globalisation also provides opportunities for emerging economies to adopt existing technologies to modernise their economic structures and develop higher value added goods and services. But openness to trade and investment as well as international co-operation in STI will be important in helping build the absorptive capacity to adopt such technologies	innovation activities *** home country *** framework conditions *** policy instruments *** public private partnerships *** host country *** global innovation networks *** small and medium sized firms *** support innovation *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** research organisations *** higher education *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** research base *** global innovation networks *** research organisations *** global innovation networks *** global innovation networks *** globalisation of research *** higher education *** existing technologies *** international co-operation *** globalisation of research	internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)15	Green technology and innovation policies: Summary of the CSTP Workshop and key policy issues	2010	W2	On 25 October 2010 the CSTP held a Workshop on Green Innovation and Technology that for the first time attempted to identify the opportunities and challenges of green technology and innovation as well as to identify the scientific and policy gaps and suggest directions for specific work by the Committee and its various working parties. The CSTP workshop thus had two key objectives, namely: Provide CSTP and DSTI input [DSTI/IND/STP/ICCP(2010)4] to the OECD Green Growth Strategy concerning the potential for technology and innovation to contribute to green growth. Provide directions for the CSTP to develop a strategic approach to mainstreaming green technology and innovation across the work of its various working parties in the context of its short-term PWB 2011-2012, as well as in the context of a longer term strategy. Several issues and challenges emerged from the discussion between panellists and participants that merit additional discussion and follow-on research by governments and policy makers: (i) Mainstreaming green growth in STI policies. There is a consensus that STI is important for green growth but questions surrounding the public research sectors responsiveness to the green growth challenge remain. These include barriers around disciplinary thinking and funding, co- ordination across ministries, convergence of technologies and complexity, priority setting and stakeholder involvement. But there are also opportunities as linking the domestic research agenda to global challenges can also open up new markets for technology and innovation. (ii) Reducing scientific evidence gaps and communicating with society. There is also consensus that more science is needed to strengthen the evidence base on climate change and green growth. However, while evidence is important for developing policies, it may not be sufficient. It is therefore important that such evidence is diffused to opinion formers, industry and the political sphere with regard to what is known and where the science gaps lie. (iii) Market based mechanisms versus government mission-oriented Research and Development to achieve radical innovation. Market-based instruments, such as environmental taxes, tradable permit systems or targeted subsidies, are a cost-effective way to induce green innovations. They provide incentives to firms and consumers to opt for greener production or products. However, in terms of fostering breakthroughs, market-based mechanisms may not be sufficient. What should be the balance between this approach and government mission-oriented programmes? (iv) Targeting of STI policies for green technology and innovation versus a broad policy mix. A controversy exists whether policy should apply a targeted or a technology-neutral strategy, or a mix of both. In general, developing green technologies will require investment in a range of underlying research fields and technologies, including in areas where these  technologies  converge as in the case of ICTs and new materials technologies. As proposed by the IEA (see Figure 2), this latter approach can be considered as technology neutral where government supports investment in a broad range of technologies and the markets select the most cost- effective and profitable solution (Phase 1). Targeted government actions can be undertaken when technological milestones are reached or first indications of market uptake are noticeable (Phase 2). Regardless of whether the focus should be on funding more targeted Research and Development or a broad- based technology neutral approach or a balance between the two approaches, governments still struggle with defining specific priorities and funding levels as well as developing the necessary infrastructure, research networks and human resources. (v) Complexity and transition management. In order to address the uncertainty and complexity of environmental  problems  and  the  interdependence  of  related  policies  (e.g.  multi-ministerial participation in policies related to green innovation), there is a need for transition management. Pioneered by the Netherlands, the approach is expected to enable government to organise its policy around a cluster of options, without choosing specific solutions, while giving an overall policy  direction  to  the  market.  But  transition   also   involves   both   losers   and   winners (e.g. incumbents in fossil fuel based sectors versus green technology IP holders in new industries), and the management of transition should address these issues both within countries but also between them. (vi) Policy instruments for linking supply and demand. Besides policies that support innovation partnerships (e.g. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP in Research and Development) and clusters/innovation platforms (c.f. Presentations of Japan, Israel and Norway), other examples of bringing demand and supply-side measures together include voucher schemes, lead-market initiatives, customer-supplier platforms, etc. However, there has been little empirical work on the process through which these demand-side and supply- side innovation measures interact and their impact on the development and diffusion of green technologies and innovation in particular. (vii) International collaboration on green technology and innovation. For many countries, addressing global challenges through STI offers new opportunities and new rationales for multilateral collaboration. Traditionally multilateral collaboration in STI has focused on large research infrastructure as a way to share costs or generate economies of scale and scope. There are new multilateral arrangements emerging that provide flexibility, with shorter time horizons (e.g. EU Joint Programming initiatives) involving regular assessments and an opportunity to exit when countries face decreasing returns. But is the level of action sufficient to solve major gaps in STI? One problem amongst others is that spending internationally rather than nationally is a challenge for any government. Hence, there is a need to make the real and significant benefits of international collaboration visible. There is however also political consensus that addressing the challenges on environmental sustainability requires collective actions beyond any existing collaboration mechanisms that exist today.	green technology and innovation *** green growth *** green technology and innovation *** green growth *** public research *** green growth *** priority setting *** stakeholder involvement *** global challenges *** technology markets *** green growth *** policy development *** mission-oriented research *** green technology and innovation *** policy mix *** green technology and innovation *** human resources *** transition management *** green technology and innovation *** transition management *** green technology and innovation *** transition management *** policy instruments *** support innovation *** public private partnerships *** green technology and innovation *** development and diffusion *** green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** international collaboration *** global challenges *** international collaboration *** environmental sustainability *** green technology and innovation	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)16	STI POLICY HANDBOOK	2010	P	The STI Policy Handbook is a web-based platform that aims to facilitate collective learning processes around science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. The Handbook is pitched at complementing the already sophisticated arrangements OECD countries have in place for STI policy assessment and design. The primary building blocks of the Handbook are modules that cover the main domain areas having an impact on a countrys innovation performance. These constitute the entry-points to the Handbook and navigate the user towards particular types of analysis within a multi-stage policy process. Taken together, these amount to an information infrastructure that supports analysis and interpretation within the policy process. This shows that there are different types of key questions that help users to better understand: The contributions the domain area can be expected to make to innovation performance and how these could be measured ; The opportunities and limits for meaningful benchmarking with other countries and over time ; The various types of bottlenecks that could hamper a domain areas contributions to innovation performance ; The policy options for improving the domain areas performance and the contributions it can make to innovation. The analytic components outlined above are used not for their own sake but as a means for progressing through a process of policy learning. The process consists of three main stages that bring the user through a logical sequence of diagnostic and problem framing, identification of goals and pathways, and the design, implementation and monitoring of a policy mix.	countrys innovation performance *** policy processes *** policy processes *** innovation performance *** policy processes *** policy mix	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)2	TIP Programme of Work for 2011-2012	2010	M	Thematic activities/projects that could be envisaged : 2.1 Best practices for linking supply- and demand-side technology and innovation policies, especially for green growth : Transitioning to a green growth trajectory requires  broad-based innovation, not only in specific technologies such as environmental or energy technologies but also non-technological and organisations innovations. However, decoupling environmental degradation from economic growth will also require radical innovations that accelerate the transition, lower economic and social costs, while putting economies on a higher growth path. This activity could explore the role of supply and demand-side policies to foster breakthrough and chabada chabado. In it could undertake analytical work to determine the contribution of green technology and innovation to a more sustainable growth path and to identify implication for STI policies on the supply and demand-side, including issues such as priority setting. 2.2 Handbook on Science, Technology and Innovation : Reflecting international learning, a lot of generic guidance is available to policy makers seeking to improve the performance of their innovation systems. Drawing upon country experiences, this activity would aim to develop a handbook or learning platform for STI policy makers/analysts that helps them take better account of a fuller range of shaping factors in their policy assessment/design  activities.  It  would  aim  to  provide  a  resource  that (i) assembles together, in one place, current knowledge of innovation dynamics and policy measures and (ii) re-packages this into a framework of policy-relevant guidance and data support. 2.3 Report on financing, transferring and commercialising knowledge : Knowledge has both public and private good characteristics. This makes the financing, transferring and commercializing of knowledge a high risk and uncertain activity. Although intellectual property frameworks, can help solve some of the spill-over problem of knowledge through appropriation, the market valuation of knowledge- and hence the risk associated with commercializing knowledge into innovation - remains a major barrier to the successful diffusion of knowledge that can bring benefits in terms of productivity and growth. This activity could examine effective mechanisms to link the development and delivery of knowledge and technology across the value chain. 2.4 Report on global knowledge and innovation networks and policy implications for national specialisation in research and innovation : In the face of globalisation of Research and Development and innovation, firms have continued to specialise in terms of production and output in order to maintain competitiveness and capture new markets. While firms are the main source of industrial specialisation, legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks, research and education systems and entrepreneurship shape the direction of specialisation. The problem is that in many OECD countries, STI policies are similar or synchronized; e.g. each countries has similar targets for Research and Development or they aim to develop their own biotech or ICT clusters along similar research and technology strategies. There is a risk this approach could foster fragmentation and duplication to the detriment of specialization that reveals competitive advantage of a given region or country. How can STI policies shape smart specialization of firms, and  so that regions and countries can capture economic benefits in a global market place. 2.5 Three policy roundtables on priority issues in innovation and technology policy. 2.6 Analytical report on policy briefs for STI Policy handbook : The OECD Handbook on Science, Technology and Innovation will  produce a range of policy briefs on specific policy instruments such as Research and Development tax credits, Public Private Partnerships for innovation or financing of innovation. Depending on voluntary contribution, much of this state-of- the-art information could be brought together, synthesized and analyzed and brought to the attention of policy makers, in a user-friendly manner	organisational innovations *** best practices *** green growth *** energy technology *** economic growth *** systems innovation *** green technology and innovation *** priority setting *** innovation systems *** policy measures *** commercialising knowledge *** intellectual property *** diffusion of knowledge *** technological knowledge *** value chains *** globalisation of research *** education and research *** public private partnerships *** policy instruments *** tax incentives	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_tax_incentives
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)4	ADJUSTING POLICIES TO THE GLOBALISATION OF Research and Development AND INNOVATION: CURRENT STATUS OF TIP WORK	2010	R	As part of its 2009-2010 work programme, the TIP is carrying out Activity 2.3 on Adjusting Policies to the Globalisation of Innovation [DSTI/STP/TIP(2008)14]. The aim of the activity is to understand how national policies to foster Research and Development and innovation may need to adjust to the globalisation process, both in view of long-term trends but also in light of the current financial and economic crisis and the emergence of new global players in Research and Development and innovation. This work follows on previous TIP work in 2007-2008 on the internationalisation of Research and Development and on open innovation in global networks	globalisation of innovation *** globalisation process *** internationalisation of research *** open innovation *** globalisation of research	internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)5	Preliminary Findings of the OMC-Net Impact Assessment Exercise	2010	R	1. In response to the growing interest in impact assessment (IA) for RTDI policy formulation, the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) has taken - together with 14 partner organizations - the initiative for an FP7 OMC-net project Common Impact Assessment for Optimising the Policy Mix (CIA4OPM) focused at an assessment of the socio-economic impacts of public funding for RTDI. The aim of this project is to contribute to the debate on policy priorities in terms of research for the coming decade, and to facilitate mutual learning and communication between policy makers and stakeholders in the policy making process. The topic of IA (focused at FP6) has been put on the successive presidency agendas of France, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Spain. This OMC-net project takes a step further in looking for more harmonized IA guidelines for all kind of RTDI policies at regional, national, and EU-level. An engagement is taken to promote the project during the Swedish, Spanish, and Belgian presidency of the European Union.	economic impacts *** policy formulation *** policy mix *** socio-economic impacts *** impact assessment *** impact assessment	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)6	SUMMARY REPORT OF THE VIENNA WORKSHOP ON NATIONAL STI GOVERNANCE	2010	W2	On 18-19 February 2010 the OECD and the Austrian Government hosted a one and a half day Policy Roundtable on STI Governance that brought together policy makers, academic experts, and business representations to explore the key governance challenges facing science, technology and innovation policy makers in OECD countries. The discussion centred around three main topics:  i) the process and outcomes of priority-setting exercises; ii) STI governance arrangements to meet societal agendas (e.g. co-ordination mechanisms, involvement of stakeholders) and iii) national STI governance arrangements to facilitate international co-operation. Part1, The increasing importance of priority setting in STI agendas. In recent years there has been a renewed interest in priority setting and related instruments, inducing strong demand for improved methodologies and international learning of best practices (Box 1). Priority setting for science and technology is the selection of certain activities at the expense of others  with an impact on the allocation of public resources. There are several classifications of types of priorities, among them the following two types: Thematic Priorities: scientific fields; techno-sciences / technologies; sectors; issues; etc. and Structural Priorities: broadly, various innovation-related measures; more specifically, these might be concerned with research, teaching, firms, regulation, financing, networking and community- building, etc. Priorities are set at different levels: i) policy (government), ii) strategic (research funding agencies), and iii) operational (research-performing institutes), i.e. the function of formulating and implementing Science and Technology priorities (highly decentralised). The discussion identified several layers of rationales for priority setting. The first being instrumental rationality or how to effectively spend public money by: Taking a longer-term, more strategic perspective, Attending to functional priorities that require a system-wide view, Bringing evidence to bear in setting future courses, Bringing in stakeholders: tapping into distributed knowledge, Introducing a stronger basis for accountability, Ensuring the public interest plays a part in steering STI systems, Selecting thematic areas where excellence can be built. A second type of rationality is political: how to frame narratives and rationales for public support of STI. A third type of rationality relate to governance: Multi-actor forums of interaction => self-organisation, Embracing community-building as the essential mechanism of priority implementation, Forums for contesting visions and expectations, Exploration of whats desirable  and not just building on existing strengths (disruption), Enabling a whole-of government approach, Government less as orchestrator and more as player, Continuous processes to build agility into the system. Finally, implementing priority setting to steer the system and alter performance depends on the national context as well as budgetary and political leadership.  Priority implementation is more likely  where a dedicated budget line has been put in place rather than attempting to get several actors to pool resources. Furthermore, much Science and Technology prioritisation over the last decade has been in the context of growing budgets  but how will the process evolve when budget cuts have to be made? To what extent is it possible to make prioritistiation more open and the outcome of hidden agendas among the various actors? The discussion also highlighted that community-building was a critical function of priority- setting processes, not just for the priorities set, but also for their implementation. The Danish Research 2025 exercise for example showed that a lot of energy went into building the process itself and making important stakeholders aware of the importance to participate in the process. Priority-setting requires considerable time and efforts (managing forums, information systems, etc.) but given the actual outcomes, the question arises  whether it may not  in some  cases  be too  burdensome  given  the returns? Over  time, however, it may be that prioritisation, as processes become gradually institutionalised, can facilitate policy learning. Part 2 STI governance arrangements to meet societal agendas. Session 2 focused on the evolving relationship between STI governance and the role of society. Key questions addressed included: i) how can STI governance arrangements foster the multidisciplinary research needed to meet societal agendas? ii) How to engage stakeholders at different levels of STI policy making and what kinds of incentives can be used for the various actors? iii) How to build dialogue between stakeholders coming from different communities (i.e. research, innovation, civil society)? and iv) What  new capabilities do traditional STI actors need to develop to participate in and fulfil the promise of such agendas? From the expert presentations it became clear that greater stakeholder involvement was the natural consequence of greater demands for STI to address social challenges. However, greater participation also raises the complexity of the system due to co-ordinations costs and the limits of technical progress.  Adaptability and capacity building for STI governance. A key issue then is to manage the adaptability and capacity of the existing structures of STI governance. This involves aligning goals between demands to focus on social problems, and sector/ministerial goals that may be in conflict. It is also important to foster experimentation and the use of extended peer review and assessment exercises. Adaptability is a longer-term process and there may be institutional path dependency. Another way to set societal agendas is to improve the relevance and prestige of multi-disciplinary research. This often requires a common source of funding. In addition, linking societal agendas into innovation programmes can also help create demand for new mission oriented programmes that respond to societal agendas. As regards barriers to stakeholder involvement were identified: Difficulty identifying relevant stakeholders, Fragmentation of stakeholders, Different levels of participation  micro meso and macro, Engaging new actors  (foundations, patient groups), Ceremonial and ad hoc participation. To better engage stakeholder participation, several paths were identified including: Engaging stakeholders at earliest stage, Mobilising  non-scientific expertise, Promoting Systemic not only ad hoc participation, Leveraging  ICT-based tools like Crowdsourcing, Creating a dialogue  including multi-directional dialogue but transforming it into action. Several questions however remained open with regard to the setting of social agendas, notably how to define social challenges? How to articulate the challenge as a goal? There is also the dichotomy between national STI governance structures and processes and societal agendas that extend beyond borders. Part 3 National STI governance arrangements to facilitate international co-operation. A third set of issues at the Vienna Roundtable focused on the links between national and international developments in STI governance. Traditionally multilateral collaboration in STI has focused on large research infrastructure as a way to share costs or generate economies of scale and scope. There is however an emerging political consensus that addressing global challenges (GCs) requires  collective actions beyond any existing collaboration mechanisms that exist today. Indeed, for many countries, addressing global challenges through STI offers new opportunities and new rationales for multilateral collaboration. There are new multilateral arrangements emerging that provide flexibility, with shorter time horizons (e.g. EU Joint Programming initiatives) involving regular assessments and an opportunity to exit when countries face decreasing returns. There are also new players such as research foundations as well as firms, opening more opportunities for forming public partnerships. Two key messages emerged from the discussion: First, global challenges do not only require new ways of transnational co-operation, they may also require changes to national STI governance arrangements. Just like firms have adopted the mantra of think global act local, governments must take into account global challenges in their national priority setting and future STI governance; Second, global challenges can have varying local and regional impacts. This means that responses by countries that are directly affected by certain challenges may not need to be global but perhaps implemented on a regional basis or among a cluster of countries that are directly affected.	governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** international co-operation *** governance arrangements *** stakeholder involvement *** priority setting *** best practices *** priority setting *** priority setting *** funded research *** funding agencies *** priority setting *** priority setting *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** stakeholder involvement *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** peer review *** societal agendas *** societal agendas *** new actors *** stakeholder involvement *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** international co-operation *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** global challenges *** global challenges *** governance arrangements *** global challenges *** governance arrangements *** global challenges *** priority setting *** governance arrangements	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)7	Possible Follow-Up Work on Demand-Side Innovation	2010	R	1. Demand-side innovation policies have recently attracted much attention from policy makers in OECD countries and beyond, partly in response to interest in increasing market demand and uptake of innovation that can address certain societal needs while improving economic performance. The Joint TIP- CIIE project on Demand-Side Innovation Policies (DSTI/IND/STP (2010)1/REV1) that was carried out during the 2009-2010 Programme of Work and Budget (PWB) represents an important milestone towards understanding the challenges and opportunities for fostering innovation through the demand-side.	demand-side policies *** fostering innovation *** demand-side policies	other_policy_areas *** objectives_of_policies *** other_policy_areas
DSTI/STP/TIP(2010)8	PROGRESS REPORT TO CSTP	2010	M	Activity 2.1 New forms of innovation: challenges for policymaking : The project is organised in four modules: i) theoretical and empirical evidence regarding emerging trends in innovation and their relevance for policy; ii) a policy inventory showing new issues/new policies in response to emerging trends in innovation  in  a  group  of  OECD  and  non-OECD  member  countries; both modules were summarised in a paper on the key messages to the OECD Innovation Strategy.  iii)  country  case  studies  on  new innovation practices and/or new policies in different economic sectors (6 country case studies finalised) and iv) synthesis of policy implications and lessons from countries experiences. Activity 2.2 Evaluation and impact assessment Completed the Secretariat submitted the final report on evaluation for Declassification. Activity 2.3 Adjusting to globalisation of innovation: The Steering Group on Globalisation (Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Italy and Korea) has completed the theoretical and quantitative analysis of Research and Development and innovation spill- overs as well as a survey of policy responses to the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation, the results of which have been incorporated into the STI Outlook 2010. A key message from the project thus far is that absorptive capacity of agents plays a critical role in shaping the impact of knowledge spill-overs as well as agglomeration effects of clustering. Furthermore, data collected for the project show that despite the recent slowdown in globalisation in terms of trade and FDI mechanisms, the structural and underlying basis for the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation remain relatively strong, driven by the emergence of new players, global value chains and the internationalisation of public research itself. Activities 2.4+2.5 Demand-led innovation policies. Completed. The revised and final report is being submitted to the CSTP for comment. Activity 2.6 Governance of science, technology and innovation : Completed. Following of a scoping paper prepared by the Secretariat Austria hosted a Policy Round-Table on STI Governance on 18-19 February. The objective was to provide TIP input to CSTP policy thinking  on STI Governance and to contribute to the OECD Innovation Strategy and follow-on work. The Roundtable focused on three main themes, namely, priority setting; the process and channels through which STI governance structures responds to agenda setting by societal stakeholders; and the facilitation of international governance structures through adjustments in national structures	new forms of innovation *** evaluation and impact assessment *** globalisation of innovation *** globalisation of research *** public research *** globalisation of research *** global value chains *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** priority setting *** governance arrangements	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes

The Steering Group on New Forms of innovation has finalised the report in January 2011 and it is being professionally edited. Activity 2.2 Evaluation and impact assessment : completed. Drawing on a range of TIP work on evaluation and impact assessment as well as co-operation with the European Commission OMC-Net project on Impact Assessment which aims to develop a common methodology for the assessment of socio- economic impacts of publicly funded research, technology and innovation activities, the Secretariat submitted the final report on evaluation for declassification by written procedure. The TIP agreed not to carry specific work on evaluation of public Research and Development in its next programme of work, but instead to include evaluation and impact assessment in the activities planned in the next work programme and in the context of the OECD Handbook of Innovation Policy. Activity 2.3 Adjusting to globalisation of innovation completed. Final report is being submitted to TIP and CSTP for discussion and declassification. Activities 2.4+2.5 Demand-led innovation policies : completed. The project focused on 3 main modules in demand-side innovation policies, namely: i) Dynamics of demand-side policies to foster innovation and new market creation. ii) A comparative analysis of demand-side innovation policies in OECD countries and iii) case studies on demand-side innovation policies and instruments.  Follow up work will continue in the context of the TIPs work on green technology and innovation (Activity 2.1, below). PART 2 : Projects ongoing under the 2011-2012 PWB. Activity 2.1 Transitioning to green innovation and technology: The role of supply and demand-side polices Objectives: Transitioning to a green growth trajectory requires broad-based innovation, not only in specific technologies such as environmental or energy technologies but also non- technological and organisations innovations. However, decoupling environmental degradation from economic growth will also require radical innovations that accelerate the transition, lower economic and social costs, while putting economies on a higher growth path. This activity will explore the role of supply and demand-side policies to foster breakthrough and chabada chabado. It will involve analytical work and case studies on the role of STI policies on the supply and demand-side, including policies such as green public procurement and innovation, regulations, public research priority setting, green innovation clusters and Public Private Partnerships. Launched, literature review underway. Activity 2.2 Handbook on science, technology and innovation. Objectives: As innovation processes and the factors that shape them become better understood, the scope for policy intervention in support of innovation performance has widened considerably. But making sense of the policy options, as well as their appropriateness in particular settings remains a challenge. The STI Policy Handbook sets out to aid assessments in support of policy design and evaluation. It does so by collecting and, crucially, ordering and packaging the significant, but fragmented, knowledge base on innovation into sets of guidance for use by policy makers and analysts alike. Being modular in structure and web-based, the Handbook will constitute a living resource that will be kept up-to-date on a continual basis. launched.  Activity 2.3 Financing, transferring and commercialising knowledge. Objectives: Commercialisation has traditionally followed a linear model of Research and Development and exploitation whether based on technology push or market-pull approaches. Underlying this model were relatively clear technological trajectories that often reflected a certain path dependency in the innovation process. However, recent developments are shaking up the process of commercialising Science and Technology knowledge with implications for policy makers. This project sets out a path towards new modes of commercialisation of knowledge and calls for a reassessment of the obstacles, opportunities and policy options for governments. The project focuses on three main modules, namely 1) Financing of commercialisation 2) Open innovation strategies for commercialisation and 3) Strategies of universities and public research organisations (including commercialisation models based on two-way flows between industry and science). Launched. The Secretariat is conducting a review of the literature with a view to prepare a scoping paper . Activity 2.4 Comparative advantage through smart knowledge-based specialisation: implications for STI Policies  Objectives: Specialisation and comparative advantage is a key driver of economic growth,  as it enables a more efficient use of scarce resources and the exploitation of economies of scale and scope. The concept of smart specialisation emerged from the policy debate in the European Union and suggests that governments can enable the capacity of firms to specialise by improving framework conditions, encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in capabilities such higher education, Research and Development and other intangible assets. Past experience  suggests that top-down approaches and industrial policies are not effective or efficient in strengthening comparative advantage, however. This activity would explore policy options for smart specialisation in a global and networked world. It would firstly review the conceptual frameworks and measurement issues underlying specialisation; in particular explore the role of knowledge and innovation networks play in transmitting knowledge and technology to increase value added and shape specialisation. It would then explore the role  of STI policies policy on the direction of specialisation in global innovation networks. Issues such as sectoral or new industrial innovation policies, priority setting for research, infrastructure and framework conditions that help firms shift specialisation patterns would be explored. Status: Scoping stage.  Activity 2.5 Three policy roundtables on priority issues in innovation and technology policy.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)11	CONTRIBUTION OF THE TIP TO THE CSTP STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS AND 2013-2014 PROGRAMME OF WORK	2011	M	The following are some policy areas that could contribute to meeting the top-down priorities set out in the CSTP Strategy. The integration of the Green Growth and Innovation strategies towards the transformation of the growth regime is a mid-term programme for policy development in which TIP could play an important role. TIP Contribution to CSTP Output Proposal for Theme A: Innovation Policy Platform, The OECDs Innovation Policy Platform (IPP- formerly STI Policy Handbook) being carried out in 2011-2012 could be continued and expanded in 2013-2014. The platform provides diagnostic  and benchmarking tools based on qualitative and quantitative data and information that could enhance the understanding of the relationship between research, innovation and technological progress on the one hand, and economic and social impacts, on the other. The IPP would also build on current TIP work on Smart Specialisation which aims to develop the knowledge base for designing smarter policies for innovation. The IPP could also expand its information base beyond the experience of advanced OECD countries to include those of emerging and developing economies. In this context, the OECD Country Reviews of Innovation and the OECD Programme on Innovation, Higher Education and Research for Development (IHERD) offer important mechanisms to tap sources of knowledge and data around innovation policy. TIP Contribution to CSTP Output Proposal for Theme B: Public Private Partnerships for entrepreneurial research training and innovation. Given changes to the research and innovation processes in the public and private sectors, Research and Development collaboration between the public and private sectors increasingly depends on entrepreneurial researchers who can bridge the gap between the laboratory bench and business development. TIP could contribute to this activity drawing on its long-standing expertise on industry-science relations, open science and open innovation processes to explore the changing rationale for PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs for research and innovation. The activity could explore the financing, organisational, management, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT arrangements and evaluation aspects of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs that are oriented towards both researcher training though collaboration with industry as well as PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs that are geared toward innovation using open innovation approaches. TIP Contribution to CSTP Output Proposal for Theme C: Chabada chabado for Green Growth. The NIS framework has long recognised the need to align supply with demand through greater interactions among innovation agents and stakeholders, including government, consumers and users. Drawing on recent TIP work on linking supply and demand-side innovation policies for green technology, future work by TIP could focus on helping countries identify and develop policies to strengthen supply-demand linkages upstream in the context of joint production models but also downstream through the use of open innovation models anchored in clusters and other innovation eco-systems. A sectoral perspective adopted by TIP in the past could be used again to explore the demand-supply chains for green technologies.	policy areas *** green growth *** innovation and growth *** policy development *** socio-economic impacts *** knowledge base *** smart specialisation *** higher education *** education and research *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** innovation process *** collaborative research and development *** innovation process *** public private partnerships *** open science *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** public private partnerships *** open innovation *** green growth *** systems innovation *** model of innovation *** green technology and innovation *** demand-side policies *** open innovation *** green technology and innovation	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)13	PROGRESS REPORT:SMART SPECIALISATION STRATEGIES FOR CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT IN GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS	2011	P	Specialisation is a driving force for economic growth in a global economy and enables the exploitation of economies of scale and differentiation for the creation of value. While the economic literature tells us that firms, not countries, specialise, the concept of smart specialisation recognises a complementary role for governments at national/regional and even local levels to shape economic specialisations by encouraging entrepreneurs and firms to identify and exploit their knowledge assets especially those arising from investments in science, technology, innovation and education. These knowledge-based specialisations can help improve the competitiveness firms and exploit the innovation potential of regions/countries. Smart specialisation offers opportunities for governments to be creative and open in pursuing ways to eliminate the fragmentation and duplication of Research and Development investments. It is a learning process where new mechanisms and mindsets are needed to identify the original and new areas of expertise in every country and region. This may require increasing the governmental networking opportunities (global/local governance) and also the interaction with all kind of actors. The present TIP activity on Designing smart specialisation strategies for cluster development in global value chains aims to act as a policy laboratory. The main aim of the activity is to contribute to a shared strategic intelligence for the development and monitoring of innovation strategies for smart specialisation. OECD can play its role in setting standards, providing indicators and policy frameworks based on good practices, and can organise mutual policy learning.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)14	ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCING FOR Research and Development AND INNOVATION	2011	R	This paper reviews general trends in public and private financing of Research and Development in OECD and non-OECD economies in the period prior to start of the recent global economic and financial crisis until now. The paper also examines a variety of financing approaches which aim to mitigate constrained access to finance, and seeks to explore new ways of financing Research and Development from the policy perspective. Overall Research and Development spending has been on the increase over the past decades in OECD and non-OECD economies. However, the latest financial crisis particularly in Euro zone economies raises the risk of adverse effects on Research and Development spending in the years to come. Results from the McKinsey Global Survey of 2009 and 2010 show that executives at companies, who cut their Research and Development costs are likely to worry about repercussions such as a reduced market share, a loss of technological ground to competitors, a weaker Research and Development talent pool, a loss of institutional knowledge, and damage to company morale. On the other hand, a great number of companies, especially high-growth firms appear to have used the economic crisis as an opportunity to maintain or even increase their long-term superiority over the competitors. They are also likely to be proactive in both streamlining core Research and Development processes and the expansion of Research and Development infrastructure. The survey on the access to finance of chabadu chabados in Euro area by the European Central Bank (April 2011) reveals that chabadu chabados considered access to finance as one of the most pressing problems and suffer from financing constraints more severely than those of large firms. Euro area bank lending survey also confirm that chabadu chabados generally face serious financing tightening potentially due to growing concern over a re- intensification of the sovereign debt crisis.. Innovative financing for new ventures via business angels and venture capital also faces constraints, in particular, for small, young Research and Development-intensive technology-based firms. The role of venture capital has become increasingly important as entrepreneurial source of financing. The investment by business angels and venture capitals appears to be generally stable despite a mild fluctuation depending on the business cycle. Most notably, venture capital tends to invest at later stage rather than at early stage, and the financing gap between early and later stages is filled by business angels. Public private partnerships are increasingly viewed as an efficient means to overcome financial bottlenecks by sharing risk and finance between the public and private sectors in the provision of public services. Incentives for public private partnerships include fiscal pressures on government, the important role of private sector in the provision of semi-public goods, and well-designed legal frameworks. Collaborative Research and Development between public and private sector also offers opportunities for meeting shared objectives by mitigating the scarcity of financial resources. The major key issues associated with Research and Development and innovation as a consequence of recent economic crisis are developed in DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)15. Given the deteriorating economic condition, overall Research and Development spending could be highly vulnerable in a number of countries. There is growing concern that access to finance would be aggravated significantly and as a result, innovative activities could retract over time. At this critical stage, advanced and innovative financing approaches are extremely important to stimulate entrepreneurial activities, Research and Development and innovative start-ups. The following policy issues are worth considering:    To what extent can public Research and Development play a moderating and co-ordinating role to business Research and Development? Business Research and Development is much likelier to be pro-cyclical than is the public sector. It is important to keep overall Research and Development investment steady and stable without sharp fluctuation through well-defined policy instruments, which relates closely to innovation and economic growth. In addition, to what extent can public Research and Development support more longer-term and higher-risk projects?  Collaborative Research and Development both domestic and cross-border is viewed as important component that can allow Research and Development actors to overcome the constraints to resources such as funding, labour, and technology by sharing resources and even diversifying risks among the participants. Under the open innovation model, Research and Development actors can mobilise a variety of resources to implement Research and Development activities through complementary co-operation, based on the areas of mutual interests.  The economic downturn provides a good opportunity to review Research and Development performances and closely examine the full process of Research and Development activities, through which inefficient factors will be eliminated, and structural adjustments will be made in Research and Development processes. These measures might be painful, but will certainly streamline processes and improve Research and Development efficiency. Taken into account growing trends in Research and Development spending over the past years, a restructuring of Research and Development is perceived as a way to improve efficiency of the Research and Development process, particularly from the perspective of allocation of constrained resources and setting of investment priority.  Government grants for Research and Development and commercialisation represent an important source of financing for feasibility studies and pre-commercial product development. The distribution of grants serves as an effective instrument for dealing with uncertainty inherent to the commercialisation of scientific knowledge and, especially, helps increase financing opportunity for entrepreneurial firms at early stage which suffer from financial constraints.  As regards venture capital, proper incentive structures are important for private investment managers to select and develop high-growth, commercially viable companies. Empirically compensation incentives such as stock options, convertible preferred stock, participating preferred security (SBIC in US), option to purchase the governments shares up to five years (Yozma in Israel) have been a significant contributor to a great success in venture fund management, improving the risk-return profile of innovative enterprises. Active co-operation among globally competitive venture capitalists could strengthen the foundation for boosting venture industry, thus sharing diverse experiences and know-how in such process, which will increasingly enhance the quality of venture capital management.  A mature entrepreneurial culture plays a pivotal role in inspiring entrepreneurship, which will serve as a catalyst for promoting entrepreneurial activities. Such a favourable environment can be nurtured and improved through continuous education, free flow of information, networks of business angels and venture capitals, adequate taxation associated with venture capital.  New and innovative financing approaches offer businesses to diversify sources of financing. These include Public Private Partnerships, which aims to provide better public services by sharing risk and resource; corporate venturing, which aims to turn new ideas and technologies into commercial reality through the independent external start-up companies from the strategic perspective; and crowding funding, which makes it easier for even young and small businesses to raise funds. What other forms of innovative financing could be tapped to increase and diversify the sources of Research and Development financing?	supporting research and development *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** business angels *** technology based firms *** venture capital *** venture capital *** business angels *** venture capital *** business angels *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** private sector *** collaborative research and development *** innovation activities *** business research and development *** public research and development *** business research and development *** public sector *** research and development expenditures *** economic growth *** policy instruments *** public research and development *** supporting research and development *** collaborative research and development *** model of innovation *** research and development activities *** open innovation *** research and development activities *** product development *** venture capital *** incentive structures *** venture capital *** venture capital *** business angels *** public private partnerships	firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)15	TIP THEMATIC WORKSHOP ON FINANCING Research and Development AND INNOVATION IN THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT: ISSUES PAPER	2011	R	1. This background document to the TIP Thematic Workshop on Financing Research and Development and Innovation in the Current Macroeconomic Context draws an initial picture of the impacts of the current business cycle on innovation. The discussion is organized around eight key questions; below is a summary of the preliminary answers the document provides:  Question 1: What to expect for innovation as a result of the crises? Innovation might both thrive and suffer during downturns in reaction to the decrease in demand, the lack of liquidities in the financial system, increased uncertainties and the tightening of public budgets. A lot of the evidence on past recessions points to negative impacts on innovation activities.  Question 2: What has happened to innovation? Innovation activities decreased during the global financial crisis; this is the case for firm-level indicators as well as aggregate statistics on private-sector Research and Development, patenting and trademark registrations. However, there is some evidence pointing to an increase in innovations aimed at enhancing efficiency.  Question 3: Did the global downturn lead to creative destruction? Substantial firm exit has not been accompanied at the same time by entry. The result has been a persistent increase in unemployment levels and, in consequence, a break-down of the creative destruction process as new innovative businesses have not entered markets (yet).  Question 4: What has happened to innovation financing? Innovators had a harder time in accessing external financing independently of whether they sought access to banking credit or venture capital during the global financial crisis. While the situation improved subsequently problems resurfaced in the second half of 2011.  Question 5: What about the role of low demand and substantial uncertainties? The declines in consumer demand and uncertainties as to the recovery were probably substantial factors behind firms weak innovation performance.  Question 6: Will there be impacts on the global distribution of leadership in innovation? The strong growth performance of some emerging economies compared to developed countries has given them the opportunity to catch-up in terms of innovation continuing a trend that pre-dates the crisis.  Question 7: Is there a risk of long-term effects on innovation-based growth? With sluggish growth and substantial uncertainties potential long-term consequences become increasingly likely. While there is no evidence as yet on harmful disruptions to innovation investments or loss in leadership, potential losses in skills that are essential for innovation already constitute a risk.  Question 8: What about innovation policy at present? While strong innovation performance contributes to raising growth prospects high levels of public spending in its support might be a challenge for tight public budgets. Innovation policies at present need to i) foster positive long-term trends in innovation performance, and ii) avoid possible long-term damages to innovation systems caused by the crises themselves	supporting research and development *** innovation activities *** innovation activities *** venture capital *** innovation performance *** innovation investments *** innovation performance *** innovation performance *** innovation systems *** supporting research and development	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)2	ADJUSTING STI POLICIES TO THE GLOBALISATION OF Research and Development AND INNOVATION	2011	R	1. The Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) has a long standing interest in the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation.1 In 2005, following a request by the CSTP, the TIP carried out a project on the Internationalisation of Business Research and Development which focused on the evidence and drivers of the globalisation of Research and Development and identified some of the policy implications. A follow-up project in TIP on Open Innovation in Global Networks linked the globalisation of the Research and Development function in firms and public research institutions with the opening up of the innovation process more broadly, including across global value chains (GVCs). The results of both projects shed light on process of the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation with two major policy messages. First, that openness matters in both Research and Development and innovation and that policies that promote openness in trade, Research and Development related FDI, technology, talent, and ideas should be pursued. In this respect, framework conditions, including INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs, were considered essential. A second message that emerged was the importance of the public research base and the education system in training talent and generating knowledge that could enhance the attractiveness of a country as a base of the location of high value and knowledge intensive activities. 2. However there were several questions that remained unanswered. First, if innovation policies could no longer be carried out in solely in a national context, there remain questions as to how to design policies that, while promoting openness, can ensure benefits flow back to national taxpayers and stakeholders. Countries from France to Sweden, while encouraging outward and inward FDI are concerned that national firms are expanding their Research and Development abroad while foreign firms in their countries are investing in existing firms for market access but not doing so in leading edge Research and Development and innovation activities. They are also concerned that foreign firms may not be partnering with national suppliers or public research organisations, limiting potential spillovers. Furthermore, while previous research has highlighted the importance of framework conditions including INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and the tax environment for multinationals as factors for attracting high valued added production and Research and Development activities, the hierarchy of these factors is not well understood nor is it not altogether clear that these are in themselves sufficient conditions. Indeed, global markets and networks for knowledge, non-income demand-side conditions such as an innovative culture (e.g. the presence of demanding consumers who can act as test beds for lead markets for new products and services) may also play a role in the attractiveness of countries for Research and Development and innovation activities. 3. Finally, the financial and economic crisis has again brought to the fore the question of how the benefits of the globalisation process are distributed both within and between countries. The ensuing collapse in global trade at the end of 2007 also highlighted the importance of global value chains in transferring the knowledge embodied in networks of firms. Against this background, there is a need for policy makers to better understand how knowledge spill-overs arise from the processes of Research and Development and innovation locally, nationally and internationally. In addition, another gap that needs to be filled is to  1. Key studies include: OECD (2007a), Staying Competitive in the Global Economy: Moving up the Value Chain; OECD (2007b), Trade and Innovation; OECD (2008a), The Internationalisation of Business Research and Development: Evidence, Impacts and Policy Implications; OECD (2008b), Open Innovation in Global Networks; OECD (2008c), The Global Competition for Talent: International Mobility of the Highly Skilled.   understand what shapes the direction of knowledge spill-overs; what are the costs and benefits of spill- overs and understanding how these are influenced by public policy. For example, national policies to correct market or systems failures may become less effective if the problem of market failure is not located in local or national production systems but rather subsumed in a global network or global value chain (GVCs). 4. Against this background, and as part of its 2009-2010 work programme, the TIP has carried out work on Adjusting Policies to the Globalisation of Research and Development and Innovation. The aim of the work is to understand how national policies to foster Research and Development and innovation may need to adjust to the globalisation process, both in view of long-term trends but also in light of the emergence of new global players in Research and Development and innovation. In a first phase of the project an extensive literature review on spill-overs generated by Research and Development and innovation was carried out in order to map the channels and forms of spill-overs, including the role of firms, public research institutions, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and mobility in the generation of spill-overs. In a second phase, a review of the empirical evidence regarding recent trends in the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation was prepared drawing on OECD statistics and databases as well as business surveys. In a third step, the TIP developed a questionnaire on the policy responses to globalisation of Research and Development and innovation. Finally, additional desk research on the relationship between globalisation and innovation, including the difference between sectors and firms was carried out. 5. The key messages that arise from the report follow below. Delegates are invited to discuss the findings with a view to declassification of the report. The report will then be published by the Secretariat. Key findings  Despite the recent shock to globalisation via the trade and FDI mechanisms, the available data show that the structural and underlying basis for the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation remains strong.  FDI and trade remain important channels for knowledge spillovers from Research and Development and innovation, but their role is changing as production and innovation activities are organised spread across global value chains (GVCs).  Emprical evidence suggests vertical spill-overs - flows of knowledge between agents operating at different stages in Research and Development and innovation process- have more impact on firm performance than horizontal flows of knowledge flows between individuals and institutions.  Open innovation is a means of internalising knowledge spillovers.  Clustering of innovation capabilities and regional proximity play an important role in augmenting the impact of spillovers on local agents.  The international mobility of researchers and skilled workers, drawn by new hotspots of innovation around clusters of knowledge-based institutions and firms, has also helped spread tacit flows of knowledge,  There is no optimal policy mix for attracting Research and Development and innovation but framework conditions such as openness to trade and FDI, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and human capital remain important. Product and labour market policies are also important as they can reduce transaction costs for the establishment of foreign-based firms along value chains.	business research and development *** globalisation of research *** innovation process *** global value chains *** globalisation of research *** open innovation *** research organisations *** globalisation process *** globalisation of research *** framework conditions *** intellectual property *** research base *** public research *** knowledge intensive services *** foreign firms *** innovation activities *** foreign firms *** research organisations *** framework conditions *** research and development activities *** intellectual property *** new products *** innovation activities *** globalisation process *** global value chains *** business research and development *** value chains *** global economy *** international mobility *** open innovation *** systemic failures *** market failures *** value chains *** globalisation of research *** globalisation process *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** firms and sectors *** globalisation of innovation *** globalisation of research *** global value chains *** innovation activities *** innovation process *** knowledge flows *** open innovation *** innovation capacity *** knowledge flows *** framework conditions *** policy mix *** international mobility *** intellectual property *** value chains *** labour market *** globalisation of research	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)3	Scoping Paper for the TIP Project on Financing, Transferring and Commercialising Knowledge	2011	R	3. The generation and transfer of scientific and technological knowledge remains an important source of innovation, even if economists and policy makers acknowledge the contribution of non- technological knowledge to the innovation process. But market failures such as the imperfect appropriability of knowledge mean that the market is unable to provide incentives for companies to carry out long-term research. Given the public good nature of science and the benefits from spill overs, governments have supported basic and long-term research in universities and public research organisations. Up until the 1980s it was assumed that such publicly funding research would, on its own, make its way into the market through the diffusion of scientific publications and the movement of scientific personnel. But turning science-based knowledge into innovation requires different mechanisms than those that provide incentives for longer term research. It requires market institutions including finance, entrepreneurs and non-market institutions (e.g. intellectual property protection, regulations) as well as technical and management skills in the public research and business sectors. For this reason since the 1980s, many OECD countries have created supporting structures to foster the transfer, commercialisation and exploitation of publicly funded research (e.g. science parks, technology transfer offices, and incubators to name a few). 4. This model for transferring and commercialising public research results has followed a linear model of Research and Development and exploitation whether based on technology push or market-pull approaches. Underlying this model were relatively clear technological trajectories that often reflected a certain path dependency in the innovation process (e.g. the drug development model of a pharmaceutical). However, the transformation of the traditional open science systems in public research  based on the diffusion of knowledge via scientific publications - and the spread open innovation models in business are shaking up the process of financing, transferring and commercialising Science and Technology knowledge with implications for policy makers and public research organisations alike. 5. While science has always been open insofar as ideas and knowledge cross disciplines and borders, the modern concept of open science system challenges the traditional model based on the diffusion of knowledge through publications that are protected by copyright and that can limit, even the authors own use and access to the knowledge. The emerging model of open science provides an alternative to diffusion of research via copyright publications. It aims to create a scientific commons that weakens the defacto monopoly of the scientific publishing industry. This new model of open science relies heavily on trust and confidence since in the publishing world, scientific publications are peer reviewed and highly cited peer reviewed articles are the main motivation for researchers. This model also requires a different infrastructure for science; beyond faculty, university labs and notebooks. Indeed, as scientific research becomes a technology intensive activity, it requires powerful computing capacity to generate, analyse and interpret massive amounts of data. The new model of open science in this context embraces all kind of data used for scientific research, including publications, doctoral theses, laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers or physical objects (e.g. laboratory samples, strains of bacteria and test animals such as mice) and databases (OECD, 2007). 6. Compared to the traditional model of open science where copyright and legal and material issues of access to public research data restricted knowledge flows, the new open science model promotes greater access to data, increases the diffusion of knowledge, and encourage new uses of data and favours collaborative research, thus increasing knowledge spill over effects. The result is an increase in the sharing   and transfer of knowledge that is expected to lead to new discoveries, opening up new scientific, commercial and innovative opportunities. The key issue for research institutions, research funding agencies and other partners involved is to determine the scope of their open regimes and access arrangements. The rise of open science and open innovation means that the scientific publications in journals and the academic entrepreneurial path to transferring and commercialising knowledge are no longer the only options for diffusing public research results. 7. Just as firms may decide not to commercialise new technologies in-house due to changes in business strategies and the creation of markets for knowledge, universities and public research institutions, are also being confronted with alternative paths for transferring knowledge, including paths that do not involve in-house commercialisation via university start-ups but rather the transfer of knowledge via open science systems or commercialisation via indirect routes. As concerns the latter, rather than choosing to license a university invention or create a start-up and an incubator to support its development, universities may also transfer technology early on in the context of industrial contract research, consortia or public private partnerships that offer different channels for the transfer, exploitation and commercialisation of public research results. 8. Indeed, there is anecdotal information that some universities and public research institutions are rethinking traditional commercialisation strategies centred around technology transfer offices (TTOs), spin-offs and technology/business incubators technology and adopting more open innovation based strategies based on technology licensing, collaborative intellectual property mechanisms such as patent pools, and PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for Research and Development. At the same time, these institutions are increasingly promoting greater open access to public research results in order to enable the exploitation and commercialisation of such results by entrepreneurs and firms. 9. Nonetheless, several tensions arise between the traditional open science model and the new open science/ open innovation models. First, the traditional open science models focus on copyright and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT mechanisms for the transfer of knowledge is challenged by the scientific commons and open innovation approaches to sharing IP. Indeed, because of the nature of university research and its focus on publication, technology transfer offices are often required to file patents for university inventions early on. But the focus on patenting by universities is not always aligned with the open innovation approach adopted by industry. There are also tensions around the importance of scientific publishing in journals and publishing in scientific commons. Peer-reviewed scientific journals are used to promote excellence in research through competitive forces. In addition, cited publications are used to assess research performance and funding decisions. How far can science be made more open without comprising excellence? How to create incentives and training for researchers to use open methods and tools required in the new open science system? What should be the adequate degree of openness; what are the best models to structure the information in order to make the exchange of knowledge accessible; how can quality control be provided? 10. The rise of open science and open innovation is also changing the nature of the financing of innovation, in particular innovation generated by public research. Traditionally, discussion on the financing of innovation at the industry-science interface has focused on addressing market failures in capital markets as well as information asymmetries that prevent firms from accessing finance that could enable them to commercialise technologies and innovations. Over the past decades, public policies have sought to address some of the market failures that affect the ability of firms, especially chabadu chabados, to bridge the financing gap. One key area has centred on providing early stage financing and other intermediary services for firms coming out public research (e.g. university spin-offs and spin-outs). However, if knowledge is being transferred, exploited, and commercialised along different pathways than before, where are the new financing gaps (e.g. valley of death) and are existing innovation financing methods (e.g. venture funding, business angel networks) adequate to foster greater commercialisation of public research? What new tools can support the financing of commercialisation (e.g. specialised Public Private Partnerships for specific   stages of commercialisation)? How can existing structures to support commercialisation such as TTOs adapt to this new environment while meeting their own internal and external financing challenges? How can government link support to financing on the supply side to new (financial) measures to support the demand-side of innovation, including lead markets and public procurement? 11. Further work by the TIP in this project could aim to better understand the nature of open science and open innovation systems and their role in the transfer, exploitation and commercialisation of knowledge arising from public research and secondly as well as the implications for financing of innovation. It is proposed that in the next phases of this project, the TIP undertake both empirical and case study work.	innovation process *** technological knowledge *** market failures *** research

DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)4	SCOPING PAPER ON TRANSITIONING TO GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION: THE ROLE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND-SIDE INNOVATION POLICIES	2011	R	3. The TIP is carrying out activity 2.1, Report on linking supply and demand-side technology and innovation policies, especially for green growth in the 2011-2012 Programme of Work and Budget, Output Area 1.3.2, Science and Innovation Policies. This activity is part of the CSTPs follow up work to the recent OECD Green Growth Strategy which was endorsed at Ministerial level on 25-26 May 2011. The goals of the TIP activity are to:  Better understand the problems and obstacles related to bridging supply and demand-side innovation policies that limit the transition towards green technologies and innovation.  The second objective is to identify potential best policy practices for linking supply and demand side policies to accelerate or facilitate transition on a systems level. 4. This scoping paper provides an overview of most pressing issues concerning the role of supply and demand side policies in transitioning to green technology and innovation. It is structured in three sections. The first section reviews the issues on the supply-side including funding arrangements and the role of universities and public research organisations and the financing issues associated with green technology. The second section reviews the role of demand-side innovation measures in the development and diffusion of green technologies and innovations. The third section pays considerable attention to key issues and gaps in governance of STI policies that limit the ability of policy makers to align supply and demand-side innovation policies and explores some mechanisms in policy design for bridging the gap between supply and demand. 5. Delegates should note that related work on demand-side policies for eco-innovation (e.g. green public procurement, regulations, technical and performance standards) is underway in the CIIE, the sister body of the CSTP [see (DSTI/IND(2011)7]. Therefore, it is proposed that the TIP project will be co- ordinated with the CIIE project to exploit synergies while reducing unnecessary overlap, especially as concerns coverage of demand-side innovation policies. Introduction 6. Innovation, together with market-based incentives such as regulation and taxation, is a key factor in accelerating the transition to greener growth, one that helps to decouple environmental degradation from economic growth. Consequently, OECD governments as well as emerging economies are giving priority to green Research and Development activities and technologies such as renewable energy and environmental technologies. Even if there is an emerging consensus that achieving green growth will require more than clean technologies for decoupling environmental degradation from economic growth  it will also require attention to issues such as the stock of natural resources and to biodiversity, the thrust of public support to green innovation has been around environmental and energy technologies given their role in the economic productive and consumption systems. 7. As such policy makers are seeking ways to better align demand and supply-side innovation policies to foster both radical and incremental innovations in green technologies. Why is this important? First, there is the issue of cost and economic efficiency of public interventions, especially in the current context of fiscal consolidation. Second, the pressing challenge of environmental sustainability calls for new   ways to accelerate the development and diffusion of green technologies and innovation. Third, better linking supply with demand is necessary to address problems of technology lock-in and path dependency of innovation that can hamper the transition to greener growth. More specifically, many new and even existing technologies are available that can reduce industrial greenhouse emissions but their further uptake in the market remains limited by demand-side factors such as the price of green technologies relative to alternative technologies which dominate existing infrastructure and production systems (e.g. transport, energy ).	green growth *** green growth *** green technology and innovation *** demand-side policies *** policy practices *** demand-side policies *** green technology and innovation *** demand-side policies *** green technology and innovation *** research organisations *** green technology and innovation *** development and diffusion *** green technology and innovation *** governance arrangements *** demand-side policies *** public procurement *** demand-side policies *** economic growth *** environmental technologies *** research and development activities *** clean technologies *** green technology and innovation *** economic growth *** green growth *** energy technology *** green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** environmental sustainability *** development and diffusion *** green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** existing technologies *** green technology and innovation *** demand-side policies	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas
DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)5	Revised Proposal for TIP Work on Smart Specialisation	2011	S	Although todays technological, economic and societal challenges are many and large, the potential for breakthrough innovations and economic transformation is hampered by fragmentation and duplication. Innovation actors, in countries and regions all over the world, tend to look for new growth opportunities in the same knowledge-driven domains (e.g. biotech, nanotech). Smart specialisation strategies can potentially help local actor to attain sustainable competitive positions in global value chains by exploiting their positions and context-based comparative advantages in innovation. This project wants to identify good practices in policy development, methodologies and selection criteria for designing and assessing smart specialisation strategies. The project will result in: (i) Indicator-based specialisation profiles, representing the relative specialisation of the countries and regions involved in the project in the different stages of the innovation trajectory, as a tool for strategic monitoring. (ii) Strategic governance profiles of the countries involved in the project, allowing countries to benchmark their capacity for managing the 'discovery' of smart specialisations, and the role of their research and innovation policies, their regional policies and their industrial policies to promote smart specialisation strategies. (iii) One or two case studies per country, enabling an in-depth analysis of real-life experience in policies and governance mechanisms for building smart specialisation strategies taking a multi- level perspective: at cluster level or/and at different government levels. (iv) A final report with insights on good methodological practices for designing and monitoring smart specialisation strategies and a self-assessment tool for upgrading existing regional strategies to the challenge, including i) selection criteria for prioritising strategies in the regions; ii) use of strategic monitoring tools; iii) changes in policy mixes and governance, as well as methods for identifying future opportunities and challenges. The project will cover five steps in the period 2011-2012.  Step 1: the construction of standardised specialisation profiles  consisting of quantitative indicators  that present a state-of-the-art analytical picture of present knowledge specialisations of the countries and regions involved in the project (a tool for strategic monitoring and assessment). Step 2: the development of a template for the representation of qualitative information on governance mechanisms and cluster policies supporting smart specialisation, including strategic intent and priority setting of leading actors. Step 3: the construction of strategic governance profiles for the countries involved in the project, building on both the template developed in step 2 and drawing upon the profiles detected in step 1, as a basis of benchmarking and policy learning on strategic capacity building for smart specialisation. Step 4: the development of one or two case studies per country, representing real-life experiences in developing and building smart specialisation strategies in clusters, in order to deepen the understanding of governance mechanisms, policies and methods for strategy development for future smart specialisation (testing also the role of the strategic intelligence). This case-based approach will focus on the interaction between national and regional policy levels to support smart specialisation. Step 5: the writing of a final report with insights on best practices for designing new smart specialisation strategies and upgrading existing cluster and regional strategies for international specialisation, including relevant and robust selection criteria, decision-making processes, strategic monitoring tools and governance mechanisms. This will be presented as a self- assessment tool. The final report will collect all validated profiles and cases to draw policy lessons for the organisation of the discovery process of smart specialisations at regional and international governance levels. In particular it can address the ways in which policy spillovers can be better exploited through mutual alignment of international differentiation in knowledge investments.	societal challenges *** smart specialisation *** global value chains *** comparative advantage *** policy development *** good practices *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** governance arrangements *** smart specialisation *** policy mix *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** governance arrangements *** priority setting *** smart specialisation *** governance arrangements *** development strategies *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** governance arrangements *** smart specialisation *** best practices *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation

DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)8	ACTIVITIES report to CSTP	2011	M	Activity 2.1 Transitioning to green innovation and technology: The role of supply and demand-side polices : The Secretariat presented the scoping paper at the June TIP meeting and the main outcomes regarding further project work were to 1) limit the scope of the issues to be addressed in the case studies 2) focus on systemic approaches to solving problems in the green space rather than focusing on individual instruments 3) undertake additional work on defining green technology, on transition management and on chabada chabado.  Activity 2.2 Innovation Policy Platform (formerly Handbook on science, technology and innovation) : A technical report on the Innovation Policy Platform was distributed to Delegates in the spring for comments and suggestions. Following the TIP meeting in June, the Secretariat has developed a basic (test) web site to allow for piloting of the module on  the interactions between public research and innovation. This web-based should give a foretaste of what the IPP will look like. This includes one module (PSR), and an embryo information system. Activity 2.3 Financing, transferring and commercialising knowledge : The Secretariat presented a scoping paper at the June TIP meeting. Subsequently, participating countries were invited to complete a template for case studies on new modes and open innovation strategies for commercialising knowledge. Activity 2.4 Designing smart specialisation strategies for cluster development in global value chains : The TIP held a scoping workshop in Leuven, Belgium on 5 May 2011 to focus the scope of the project towards practical deliverables, which will be supported by voluntary contributions (in-kind and in-cash through a European Commission/DG-Regio Grant). Currently, 11 countries are actively participating in the project through case study contributions while 2 additional countries are participating as observers. The TIP is organising, together with the Regional Government of Andalusia and IPTS, and with support from DG-Regio, a Joint Workshop on Smart Specialisation Strategies: Concepts and Tools to be held on 22-24 November at Seville, Spain. This workshop will cover the following topics: 1) Discussion of Specialisation Profile template and first results for all participating countries and regions (prepared by ECOOM operating for Belgium as the lead country); Discussion of the Governance template and first round of policy learning on capacities needed for developing smart specialisation strategies; Preparation of Case-Studies on strategy development for  smart  specialisation. Multi-level and cross-level approaches. Use of strategic monitoring; Activity 2.5 Research and Development and Innovation in Services : An expert meeting was held on 27 September 2011 to draw on the expertise of academic researchers, delegates from the OECD Working Parties of National Experts on Science & Technology Indicators (NESTI) and on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) as well as representatives from various EC bodies.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2011)9	PROGRESS REPORT -- TRANSITIONING TO GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION: THE ROLE OF SUPPLY- AND DEMAND-SIDE POLICIES	2011	P	The TIP is carrying out a report on linking supply- and demand-side technology and innovation policies, especially for green growth. Innovation, together with market-based incentives such as regulation and taxation, is a key factor in accelerating the transition to greener growth. To foster green innovation, green growth strategies need to address the following challenges: Many environmental externalities are underpriced or not priced at all. For example, a carbon  price can encourage innovation to tackle climate change, but current levels of carbon prices are too low to provide the necessary incentives. New technologies may find it hard to compete with existing technologies, establish a place in the market and scale up, in particular in markets such as energy and transport, where existing technologies dominate. Investment in relevant research and temporary support for the development and commercialisation of green technologies may be needed in certain cases. This support has to foster the emergence and uptake of efficient technologies while minimising the risks of technology lock-in, lack of competition or crowding out of private investment. Strengthening markets for green innovation is also important, for example through well designed public procurement standards and regulation. Barriers to trade and investment can place a serious brake on the development and diffusion of green technologies. Reducing these barriers and providing effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs) are essential to encourage the development and diffusion of technologies  and  the  facilitation  of  foreign  direct  investment  and  licensing.  Multilateral cooperation will also be needed to facilitate access to green technologies for the least developed countries. Why is this important? There is the issue of cost and economic efficiency of public interventions, especially in the  current context of fiscal consolidation. The pressing challenge of environmental sustainability calls for new ways to accelerate the development and diffusion of green technologies and innovation. Better linking supply with demand is necessary to address problems of technology lock-in and path dependency of innovation that can hamper the transition to greener growth. More specifically, many new and even existing technologies are available that can reduce industrial greenhouse emissions but their further uptake in the market remains limited by demand-side factors such as the price of green technologies relative to alternative technologies which  dominate existing infrastructure and production systems (e.g. transport, energy). Policy makers should have limited expectations about the extent to which one-dimensional policy descriptions, either supply or demand, will induce non-incremental innovations in the green sphere. It provides a way to capture the ideas of synergies and system effects, i.e. that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It is not simply that both supply and demand factors contribute; they also interact with each other. Demand-pull and technology-push are Necessary, but not sufficient, for innovation to result; both must exist simultaneously. Given the complexity of identifying good policy practices to foster the transition towards green technology innovation through better linking supply and demand-side innovation policies, the TIP decided to take an open approach to ensure that a range of issues will be covered in order to reflect the systematic nature of this project. The case studies themselves will be drawn on policy experience from general, sectoral and programme levels. Seven case studies are underway.	green growth *** green growth *** green technology and innovation *** new technologies *** existing technologies *** green technology and innovation *** public procurement *** green technology and innovation *** development and diffusion *** green technology and innovation *** technology diffusion *** development and diffusion *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** development and diffusion *** green technology and innovation *** environmental sustainability *** green technology and innovation *** existing technologies *** green technology and innovation *** demand-side policies *** policy practices *** green technology and innovation	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)1	PROGRESS REPORT ON THE OECD INNOVATION POLICY PLATFORM (IPP)	2012	P	The OECD is currently undertaking a project to build an Innovation Policy Platform (IPP) (referred to as the Innovation Policy Handbook in the 2011-12 PWB) that aims to collect together OECD and national materials and to transform them into strategic policy intelligence to aid tailored, country- specific analysis. The IPP sets out to aid assessments in support of policy design and evaluation by providing an infrastructure of web-based resources and guidance aimed at facilitating collective learning processes around science, technology and innovation (STI) policy.  Expected users include policy makers and so-called policy-shapers operating at the national, regional and sectoral levels in advanced, middle-income and developing countries.  At the heart of the IPP lies a simple relational model. The central assumptions of this model are that (a) activities can be distinguished that contribute to a countrys innovation performance and outcomes; (b) activities are performed and shaped by actors who have interests and rely upon various resources; (c) the resources and interests of actors are shaped by a range of institutional and structural influences that are often country-specific; and (d) actors and influences also reside in an existing policy landscape that needs to be understood. The layered causal logic at work here is intended to help IPP users in diagnostic and policy design work by revealing opportunities and constraints for innovation policy intervention. The approach to building the IPP has, until now, been a cautious one, as per the advice of CSTP and TIP. Efforts have had a dual focus on (i)conceptual development and testing and (ii) building a coalition of interests around the project that has seen new partnerships emerge, including with the OECDs IT department and the World Bank	countrys innovation performance *** policy interventions	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)12/ANN1	SUMMARY OF CASE STUDIES ON OPEN INNOVATION APPROACHES TO COMMERCIALISING KNOWLEDGE	2012	R	1. As part of the TIP activity on financing, transferring and commercialising knowledge, the Secretariat country launched a call for case studies on open innovation approaches to commercialising knowledge from the public and private research sectors. The paper offers a summary of the case studies of 6 countries (Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Japan, Korea and Russia) that have been received thus far, focusing on the transfer and commercialisation of knowledge. For the methodology for collection of the information therein please see template at the end of this document. 2. In the following synthesis we focused mainly on the major drivers of the policy/programme (technology push/demand pull) on the management of the Intellectual Property Rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT) and on results, insights gained and obstacles in promoting the knowledge transfer and its successful commercialisation. The programmes in the case studies have been divided into three groups based on the major approach to commercialisation. One the one hand, programmes focusing on the commercialisation of a technology developed by a university or a public research organisation. On the other, programmes aiming to answer a demand by an innovative solution (e.g. programmes initiated by private companies/corporations as in case of Japan, presented in this summary). The third approach is mixed and characteristic of an open innovation approach since the intensive interaction between the research and business is one of the most important criteria of successful commercialisation and innovation. The openness to both sides of the spectrum (research-business) and thus a capacity to bridge the gap between the demand and research in both directions is a crucial factor. 3. Special attention has been given to the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT strategies of agents in the commercialisation/exploitation phase. Based on the information in the case studies, the following appear to be critical issues or obstacles to successful commercialisation strategies:  Clear mission/programme statements regarding commercialisation/open innovation.  Acceptance by researchers (not invented here syndrome) in the public and private sector to disclosure of inventions  reducing licensing flow.  Development of an overall strategy for the management of the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.  Being selective at PROs with regard to their IP portfolios (specialisation).  Awareness of linkages between INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT and standards, especially in emerging technologies.  Use of collaborative mechanisms in licensing academic inventions.  Senior staff involvement and training at TTOs.  Importance of public funding to foster collaborative and open innovation with firms.	commercialising knowledge *** business research and development *** open innovation *** commercialising knowledge *** intellectual property *** knowledge transfer *** public research *** technology commercialisation *** research organisations *** business research and development *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** private sector *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** open innovation *** commercialising knowledge *** open innovation	policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)18	DRAFT SYNTHESIS REPORT ON INNOVATION-DRIVEN GROWTH IN REGIONS: THE ROLE OF SMART SPECIALISATION	2012	R	1. This document presents the synthesis report on Innovation-Driven Growth in Regions: the Role of Smart Specialisation as an output result of the CSTP activity 2.4 on Smart specialisation strategies for innovation driven growth carried out by the OECDs Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP). From concept to policy framework 2. In November 2009, the European Commission published the report Knowledge for Growth, the results of an expert advisory group to the EU. Tasked with finding an alternative to public policies that were seen to spread public investments in knowledge and innovation  research, education, public support to business Research and Development, etc  thinly across technology research fields such as biotechnology, ICTs, and nanotechnology, the expert group proposed that national and, especially, regional governments should encourage investment in domains that would complement the countrys other productive assets to create future domestic capability and interregional comparative advantage. This strategic proposal was coined smart specialisation and it spread quickly and was adopted in the EU 2020 Agenda with its objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Indeed, Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) are proposed as an ex-ante conditionality for future EU Structural Fund Programmes2 with a view to concentrate resources on research and innovation to maximize the impacts of the structural funds. However, the issues raised by smart specialisation go far beyond the discussion in the EU context. A number of countries, within OECD or not, are now taking interest in Smart Specialisation as one way to lead their economies out of the crisis by leveraging regional dynamism in innovation led/knowledge- intensive economic development. 3. Although initially relatively simple as a concept  the concentration of public resources in knowledge investments on particular activities in order to strengthen comparative advantage in existing or new areas  the conceptual and policy implications of smart specialisation are far more complex and transcend three distinct areas: i) the underlying role of scientific, technological and economic specialisation in the development of comparative advantage and more broadly in driving economic growth; ii) policy intelligence for identifying domains of present or future comparative advantage and; iii) governance arrangements that give a pivotal role to regions, private stakeholders and entrepreneurs in the process of translating specialisation strategies into economic and social outcomes. 4. In this sense, smart specialisation is a regional policy framework for innovation driven growth. That said, many of the underlying elements of the smart specialisation approach are not new and have been part of the broader discussion on innovation, industrial policies and regional economic development for some time.  2 However, the choice as to whether the smart specialisation strategies should be prepared at a regional level or a national level rests with the EU Member states.   5. What distinguishes smart specialisation from traditional industrial and innovation policies is mainly the process defined as entrepreneurial discovery - an interactive process in which market forces and the private sector are discovering and producing information about new activities and the government assesses the outcomes and empowers those actors most capable of realising the potential (Foray, 2012; Hausmann and Rodrick 2003). Hence smart specialisation strategies are much more bottom-up than traditional industrial policies. In addition, the focus of the choices is on the enabling knowledge-based assets, both public (e.g. education, public research) and private, not on particular industries. This more upstream approach gives more of a margin for the market to determine and lead on downstream choices. Still, the operationalisation of entrepreneurial discovery processes from a policy perspective is a major challenge and requires the collection and analysis of diverse information that often is held by entrepreneurs themselves or embedded in firms and public institutions. Incentives and instruments for disclosing  passively or actively  this information (e.g. through stakeholder consultations, Public Private Partnerships, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs) will be key. 6. Like traditional industrial policy, smart specialisation strategies aim to address market/systems and co-ordination failures. But traditional industrial policies required significant levels of information to justify subsidy support and they tended to be implemented in vertically integrated sectors with stable technological paradigms. In contrast, smart specialisation recognises the lack of perfect information, the level of advancement of a given activity, and the relative risks for policy. It thus focuses on helping entrepreneurs identify their knowledge-based strengths at the regional level and in a more exploratory approach in which public decision makers listen to market signals using a range of assessment tools (e.g. SWOT analysis, surveys) and mechanisms such as Public Private Partnerships, technology foresight and roadmapping to name a few. Risks of policy induced specialisation 7. While the central tenet of the concept of smart specialisation was quickly accepted by the EU policy community, especially with a view to increasing synergies and avoiding duplication in national and EU research and innovation funding, the implicit idea of policy-induced specialisation in innovation have raised concerns amongst economists and others inside and outside the EU policy circles (Pontikakis, D.  et. al. 2009). First among these are the problems of:  Government picking winners: To what extent does smart specialisation lead governments to favour some Research and Development/technology and innovation activities at the expense of a market-driven allocation of resources? Indeed, experience with industrial policy in OECD countries has shown that any policy involving picking winners - such as supporting firms to produce renewable energy technologies through subsidies or taxes is difficult to implement and could be wasteful from a social welfare point of view (e.g. to the extent that some activities would have been undertaken even in the absence of policies), and could lock in inefficient activities and encourage rent-seeking.  Competition effects: Another important concern is the prescription for a policy-induced division of labour between leading and lagging regions due to assumptions about the role of technology in traditional or leading edge sectors. A policy that targets public Research and Development towards an area of existing strength, such as agriculture, may deepen interregional disparities though the reduction of competition and market/merit based selection. Indeed, some duplication is a side-effect of competition and may be beneficial from a societal point of view.  Diminishing returns: Another concern that arises from the concentration of Research and Development investments is that of the diminishing returns to Research and Development.   8. To allay some of the concerns about smart specialisation scholars and policy advocates point out that it is a vertically-oriented policy framework for priority setting at the regional level that combines bottom-up and top down process in priority setting for public investments in knowledge. They also point out that smart specialisation depends on good general framework policies (e.g. competition, trade policy, labour market policy and education and skills) and horizontal innovation policies (e.g. Research and Development tax credits). A smart specialisation strategy means that government efforts and resources dont all go to the same extent to all activities: that concerns various types of support to innovation, but also other involvement with industry, education etc. An important issue is then how to select the relevant areas where government will focus its effort. The main principles of the smart specialisation framework can be summarised as follows:  Concentration of public investments in Research and Development and knowledge on particular activities is crucial for regions/countries that are not leaders in any of the major science or technology domains. Past policies tended to spread knowledge investment (e.g. high education and vocational training, public and private Research and Development) too thinly, not making much of an impact in any one area. However, concentration in the smart specialisation context is about focusing knowledge investments on activities  those business functions carried out by firms which range from the conception of a product to its end use and beyond (e.g. design, production, marketing, distribution and support to the final consumer) (Porter, 1986; Gereffi et al., 2001). These activities (e.g. goods or services) may be undertaken by a single firm or divided among different (supplier) firms and be concentrated within one location or spread out over global value chains (OECD, 2012a). The emerging feature of many of these activities is that they increasingly cut across established sectors and industries.  Smart specialisation relies on an entrepreneurial process of discovery that can reveal domains of economic activity where a country or region excels or has the potential to excel in the future. It empowers entrepreneurs who are able to combine the necessary knowledge about science, technology and engineering with knowledge of market growth and potential in order to identify the most promising activities. In this learning process, entrepreneurial actors have to play the leading role in discovering promising areas of future specialisation, because the needed adaptations to local skills, materials, environmental conditions, and market access conditions are unlikely to be able to draw on codified, publicly shared knowledge, and instead will entail gathering localised information and the formation of social capital assets. One implication for policy makers is that this requires ensuring policy tools to collect the entrepreneurial knowledge embedded in the region to transform it into policy priorities. In this context, entrepreneurial actors are not only the people creating new companies but also innovators in established companies, in academia or in the public sector.  Specialised diversification: specialisation on the selected activities (out of a related variety) that provide comparative advantage based on differentiation of their operations and products in global markets.  The specific properties of General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) underlie the logic of smart specialisation. Invention of a GPT extends the frontier of invention possibilities for the whole economy, while the co-invention of applications changes the production function of a particular sector. GPTs are important for upgrading upstream and downstream of the value chain. The leading regions invest in the invention of a GPT or the combination of different GPTs (e.g. bioinformatics). Regions do not need to lead in these technologies to benefit. In fact, follower regions often are better advised to invest in the co-invention of applications around a GPTs. Benefiting from GPTs generally also requires alignment with education and training policies in order to build capacity.    Multi-governance and inter-regional policy co-ordination: setting common goals for drawing up regional strategies and to allocate public funding accordingly. Smart specialisation strategies are interlinked by nature through complementary activities at horizontal level and require horizontal policy coordination. But they are in particular co-defined by the vertical alignment of entrepreneurial activity, partnering in clusters, regional development strategy and interregional and international arrangements that all are part of a multi-level governance structure for smart specialisation. Setting common goals therefore constitutes a powerful governance mechanism for the vertical alignment of these strategies, without jeopardising a market-oriented process of resource allocation. This multi-level governance co-ordination requires the synchronisation of both national strategies with regional strategies and the synchronisation of different regional strategies (e.g. innovation strategies, research strategies, industrial strategies), to support regional priorities.  Patterns for structural change: Structural change, not just the accumulation of capital, is a driver of economic growth. As such smart specialisation aims to accelerate structural change by encouraging the transformation of economic activities from a structural perspective. It may in some cases mean modernising existing industries or enabling lagging sectors to improve their competitiveness through the adoption of ICTs, but for front runner countries it can also mean developing new areas at the edge of the technological frontier (e.g. radical formation). The global economic context for smart specialisation 9. Since 2009, and following the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis, including the current euro debt crisis, the concept of smart specialisation has found an echo in the OECD discussions on New Industrial Policy, New Sources of Growth and New Approaches to Economic Challenges. Indeed, the OECD has exhorted countries to go structural to make economies more competitive; to go social to address the increased inequality and lack of jobs; to go green to promote a growth path that takes due account of environmental constraints; and to go institutional to address the current confidence gap in institutions and markets. Smart specialisation is one several frameworks that accommodates many of these goals by focusing on promoting structural change in the economy through investments in knowledge-based assets and better governance in STI policy making. Although smart specialisation has arisen in the EU context of market integration, regional cohesion and the European Research Area, similar strategies are based on targeting of public investments and top-down and bottom up initiatives are visible in regions and states as varied as in Australia, Michigan or California in the United States as well as Korea and Singapore. 10. Strategies for concentrating investments in knowledge-based assets on particular activities through an entrepreneurial-led process have also found fertile ground at the OECD as the result of a confluence of different developments. On the one hand, many OECD countries have entered a period of slow growth, high unemployment, and low demand and high public deficits. And innovation is thus seen a key to re-start growth and investment. General purpose technologies (GPTs) in particular are seen as way to revitalise existing industries and to stimulate innovation downstream including innovation in services (e.g. ICT services for public health). 11. On the other hand, globalisation and advances in ICT allow firms to fragment their production in the global value chain. As a result, the relevant unit in the economic analyses is not the industry or sector but the business function or activity along the supply chain (e.g. design, Research and Development, procurement, operations, marketing, and customer services). Countries tend to specialize in specific business functions or activities rather than specific industries (e.g. assembly operations for China or business services for India). This rise of GVC illustrates why specialisation no longer takes place solely in industries but in specific functions or activities in the value chain (OECD, 2012a).   12. At the same time, the crisis has also exposed the vulnerability of global value chains to demand and supply shocks and has also forced OECD governments to look more closely at where economic value is created along global value chains, and whether knowledge spill-overs can be captured locally by enhancing linkages between local and foreign actors. Place-based growth is seen as particularly important for innovation given the weight of agglomeration economies (OECD 2011). The smart specialisation approach responds to the need to better position regions/regional clusters in global value chains but also, for those regions where it is more relevant, in local and regional production systems. Key policy findings 13. The TIP project, organised around several modules - a theoretical and empirical literature review, detailed economic and technological specialisation profiles of regions and countries, a survey of governance mechanisms for smart specialisation in self-selected countries and country case studies - has generated a rich amount of material. Some of the key policy messages include:  Policies for entrepreneurial discovery. The smart specialisation approach calls for an entrepreneurial selection of market opportunities (e.g. to minimise failures and to avoid ill- informed policy decisions). In practice, this means the promotion of entrepreneurship across the board. While successful companies will constitute the new specialisation of the country/region (self-discovery), the role for policy is to develop a flexible strategy focusing on measurable intermediate goals, identifying bottlenecks and market failures and ensuring feed-back into policy learning processes. But the smart specialisation approach goes further, it suggests the need to consider incentives (e.g. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, prizes) to reward those entrepreneurs who discover new domains and activities and incentives (e.g. lead markets, public procurement) to attract other agents and firms and facilitate entries so that agglomeration and scale effects materialise at a later stage (Foray, 2012). One important challenge concerns how governments deal with the de-selection or the abandonment of support to certain activities.  Promoting General Purpose Technology platforms and networks. Given the range of applications of general purpose technologies, technology platforms involving public and private actors but also standards settings organisation can leverage productivity in existing sectors or help reveal or identify sectors in which to concentrate resources. Not all regions need to posses leadership in these technologies to benefit. Indeed, they can purchase or access such platforms from the market in neighboring regions or abroad. Follower regions, however, may be better advised to invest in the co-invention of applications around a GPTs. Benefiting from GPTs generally also requires alignment with education and training policies in order to build capacity.  Diagnostic and indicator based tools and infrastructure. The TIP project has demonstrated that smart specialisation requires regions and countries to maintain an infrastructure and indicator base. It has also shown that for most technological domains, there is a match between the technological and the economic performance. However, there are cases where some domains are economically strong in country but technological revealed comparative advantage (RCA) is relatively weak. For example, Upper Austria has strengthened its educational and research base in Mechatronics and Plastics to match demonstrated industrial needs (Upper Austria 2011).This information could help policy makers assess the sustainability of traditionally strong sectors, or it may inspire them to focus support on areas where research capacity is strong but economically weak, or even on activities yet nonexistent but which match well with existing capabilities in the region. In addition to quantitative indicators, qualitative data such as SWOT analyses, surveys, workshops and interviews with regional stakeholders are also important in the priority setting and discovery process. Some leading OECD regions are using very sophisticated tools to assess priority  areas  (e.g.  Lower  Austrias  Innovation  Assessment  Methodology)  as  well  as   sophisticated policy monitoring tools to assess impacts at both programme and regional level (e.g. the annual Brainport Monitor).. Lessons from the OECD case studies for the project show this kind of capacity takes time and cannot be easily improvised.  Strategic governance for smart specialisation. Three types of strategic capacities are needed to grasp future opportunities: the capacity to identify local strengths; the ability to align policy actions and to build critical mass; and the ability of regions to develop a vision and implement the strategy. The role of strategic policy intelligence as a tool for governance of smart specialisation is therefore important. In practice, the link between policy instruments and the priority setting is not explicit in the vast majority of regions and countries. Many policy makers find it difficult to move from the priority setting process to the process of developing policy instruments and the corresponding budget. In most cases, the prioritisation process is disconnected from the budgetary process. Additional governance challenges including building channels for two-way communication and having skilled personnel in agencies and ministry (e.g. in Estonia, efforts are focused on engaging ministries and industry in the governance of the national innovation system more actively to ensure synchronised implementation and coordination of policies). The latter is especially a challenge for smaller and remote regions, and especially context of constraints on public finances and public sector employment.  Openness to other regions: the specialisation strategy of regions should integrate the fact that other regions are also involved in knowledge creating activities and that duplication (the not invented here syndrome) might lead to lower effectiveness and finally failure. Hence, co- operation with other regions with complementary capabilities and strategies is to be sought (e.g. the cross-border cooperation of Brainport Eindhoven Region in the Netherlands with Leuven in Belgium on ICT and LifeTec&Health).	smart specialisation *** policy frameworks *** public investment in research *** business research and development *** comparative advantage *** smart

DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)18_ANN	ANNEX TO THE DRAFT SYNTHESIS REPORT ON INNOVATION-DRIVEN GROWTH IN REGIONS: THE ROLE OF SMART SPECIALISATION	2012	R	This contribution discusses the role and use of diagnostic tools for smart specialization policy development. It highlights the difficulties in assessing the stability and sustainability of a specialization, and advocates that the development of a smart specialization policy should only take place when local entrepreneurial commitment and development have already achieved a certain level of stability and coherence. At that point in time, policy makers should decide whether and how to support these entrepreneurial processes. This chapter points to the need of engaging all entrepreneurial actors including firms, but also universities and research centers in this evaluation process. It shows how diagnosing apparent strengths, weaknesses, fits and misfits in terms scientific, technological, innovative and economic capabilities will allow policy makers to ask the right questions when evaluating specific entrepreneurial processes. The chapter gives an overview of some well-established baseline indicators for the past and present specializations of countries and regions in science, technology, and economic development. In addition, it presents a number of additional indicators that may be useful to obtain a more advanced, multi-facetted view on national or regional specializations, including potential interregional and international collaborations. 3. In times of global value chains and ambitions to restore industry competitiveness in many countries, a New Industrial Policy framework (NIP) is an important cornerstone for economic transformation agendas. A NIP is about stimulating innovation, competition and investment in know-how; it is not only about creating new economic sectors, but also about facilitating the transformation and restructuring of existing sectors/enterprises via stimulating their participation in new, global value chains. It is not just about choosing or selecting certain projects in a pure top-down, a priori manner. Instead, it is about encouraging competitiveness by focusing on the major drivers and entrepreneurial processes that create, reinforce and rejuvenate industries in view of market evolution. 4. In this respect, it is important to focus on a number of specific economic domains in order to realize the potential for scale, scope and spillovers in knowledge production and use, as these are important drivers of productivity in the domain of Research and Development and other innovation-related activities. Regions cannot do everything in the knowledge economy. But the idea of focusing on a number of specific domains is not enough to define smart specialization. Past cluster policies at the regional level have often accentuated strongly mimetic programs of local and national industrial development  resulting in fostering knowledge base standardization, wasteful duplication and the dissipation of the potential agglomeration economies at system level  as a multiplicity of imitative local government authorities compete to attract the small finite pool of mobile capital, management and knowledge resources. The resulting duplication, unproductive uniformity and lack of imagination and vision in setting Research and Development and cluster priorities can be expected to produce poor results; with most regions remaining unattractive and unable to compete with other territories in order to attract high value resources and to retain their best resources. Why would companies locate their Research and Development activities in a region with more or less the same, subcritical and ineffective knowledge base as   other similar regions? Smart specialization, on the other hand, involves the entrepreneurial discovery of what makes a local knowledge base original and distinctive and, thereby, exhibits efficiency properties at the system level  i.e. for an integrated regional system as a whole, such as the EU. 5. Smart specialization is not a planning doctrine that would require a region to specialize in a particular set of industries. It is an approach to policy that considers whether and how those activities already strong or showing promise for a region can further benefit from Research and Development and innovation. Thus, rather than suggesting that a hypothetical region with strengths in tourism and fisheries should intensify its specialization in these industries, it is a means to assess whether and in which activities that region would benefit from and should specialize in Research and Development and innovation in the sector of tourism or fisheries. Smart specialization involves building regional policy for related industry diversification, a process based on the existing capabilities and industry commons and animated by the development of Research and Development and innovation activities in some targeted domains that offer present or future strengths for the regional economy. This implies that the diagnostic tools underpinning a NIP should provide insights in the scientific, technological, innovative and economic strengths of the region or the country. This is why we need both basic and more sophisticated indicators to monitor and assess those strengths, as well as potential matches and mismatches across scientific, technological, innovative and economic activities both within regions and within global value chains.	policy development *** evaluation process *** policy frameworks *** global value chains *** stimulating innovation *** global value chains *** knowledge economy *** regional level *** knowledge base *** research and development activities *** knowledge base *** knowledge base *** innovation activities *** global value chains *** smart specialisation	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)2	UPDATE ON CURRENT ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKING PARTY ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE CSTP STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS	2012	M	Progress on activities underway in the 2011-2012 PWB of the CSTP. Activity 2.1 Transitioning to green innovation and technology: The role of supply and demand-side polices. Policy makers are seeking ways to better align demand and supply-side innovation policies to foster both radical and incremental innovations in green technologies. The Secretariat presented the progress report at the December TIP meeting and Steering Group members provided oral reports. First drafts of case studies were received. Activity 2.2 Innovation Policy Platform (formerly Handbook on science, technology and innovation) : A web-based pilot has been launched. Activity 2.3 Financing, transferring and commercialising knowledge : Following discussion at the TIP meeting, the project was refocused on open innovation strategies for commercialisation and strategies of universities and public research organisations (including commercialisation models based on two-way flows between industry and science). Work on financing was maintained in the project but as a horizontal theme. Activity 2.4 Designing smart specialisation strategies for innovation driven growth : The project will result in: 1) Indicator-based specialisation profiles, representing the relative specialisation of the countries and regions involved in the project in the different stages of the innovation trajectory, as a tool for strategic monitoring; 2) Strategic governance profiles of the countries involved in the project, allowing countries to benchmark their capacity for managing the 'discovery' of smart specialisations, and the role of their research and innovation policies, their regional policies and their industrial policies to promote smart specialisation strategies; 3) One or two case studies per country, enabling an in-depth analysis of real-life experience in policies and governance mechanisms for building smart specialisation strategies taking a multi-level perspective: at cluster level or/and at different government levels; and 4) A final report with insights on good methodological practices for designing and monitoring smart specialisation strategies and a self-assessment tool for upgrading existing regional strategies to the challenge, including: i) selection criteria for prioritising strategies in the regions; ii) use of strategic monitoring tools; iii) changes in policy mixes and governance, as well as methods for identifying future opportunities and challenges. Activity 2.5 Research and Development and Innovation in Services : The project aims at providing new evidence on recent service innovation policy trends and contributes to improving the measurement of service-based innovation activity across sectors, i.e. within the service sector itself as well as through the servitisation of industry. Two expert workshops have been held on September 2011 and March  2012. Horizontal Activity on Knowledge Networks and Markets. In collaboration with the EC KNOWINNO project, this horizontal OECD activity aims to assess the role of Knowledge Networks and Markets (KNMs) in fostering innovation. Science, Technology and Industry Outlook 2012 : he ninth edition of the STI Outlook is under preparation.	green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** open innovation *** research organisations *** commercialising knowledge *** policy mix *** smart specialisation *** governance arrangements *** innovation in services *** services sector *** knowledge networks *** fostering innovation *** knowledge networks	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)2	UPDATE ON CURRENT ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKING PARTY ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE CSTP STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS	2012	M	Possible TIP Contributions to the CSTP PWB in 2013-2014 : (a) Public Private Partnerships for Innovation (TIP could explore the changing rationale for PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs for research and innovation as   well as identify good practices in the design, operation and evaluation of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs, including the financing, organisational, management, and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT aspects).  (b) Chabada chabado : Many of todays  global challenges, such as sustainable development, energy, health and aging, require Innovation on a system-side level. The goal of chabada chabado is to enable change in the governance of  such systems  through bottom-up and top-down processes - as well as through wider participation among innovation agents and stakeholders, including government, consumers and users. The TIP could bring together the latest thinking on chabada chabado, transitions management and governance involving academics, business, and policy practitioners to update existing NIS and governance concepts and provide the basis for new policy development. (c) Innovation Policy Platform : During 2013-14, however, most effort will be devoted to populating the IPP with content, though there will still be a need to further finesse the architecture and IPP web site. By the end of 2014, the IPP will have achieved a critical mass of qualitative and quantitative content covering the most important areas of innovation policy. (d) Social Innovation : Social and societal innovations have entered the national innovation policy agenda of OECD countries in various ways. However, well-structured views and ideas about social/societal innovation and their role within innovation policy are lacking and are in high demand. The TIP could also identify emerging trends and needs in support of social innovation, and provide practical, concrete and novel insights into the development  of policies  for social innovation. (e) Open Science : Openness in Science is not new and it is central to the scientific enterprise. However, as ICTs increase the opportunities for sharing data, collaboration and the channels through which research results are diffused, the process of science research  finds itself challenged both inside and outside the research system.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)20_REV1	NEW STRATEGIES AND POLICIES FOR THE TRANSFER, EXPLOITATION AND COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC RESEARCH RESULTS	2012	R	6. Research performed in government labs and universities is an important driver of innovation. Indeed, university research was behind the development of recombinant DNA technology; the metal alkoxide process for the production of cancer treatment drugs; and even the Google search engine. Similarly, the worldwide web, the global positioning system (GPS) and the MP3 technology were developed at public research research laboratories  European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) , Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Fraunhofer Institute, respectively. Apples Siri voice recognition technology can be traced back to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) which used DARPA funding for research on artificial intelligence. The development of LED technologies can also be traced back to research in optics by Oleg Vladimirovich Losev in 1926 who worked at Soviet government labs. But it is not just the technical inventions from universities and public research institutions (PRIs) that drive innovation. Non-technological innovations such as organisational innovation also owe a lot to academic research in areas such as sociology, mathematics, psychology, finance and organisational behavior. Internet companies, for example, employ sociologists with expertise in social network analysis to help them develop new products and services. 7. New channels for transferring knowledge are emerging and could accelerate the commercialisation of public research. The transfer, exploitation and commercialisation of knowledge generated by public research takes place through: a) scientific publications b) the movement of student and faculty to industry and c) the commercial activities of universities, mainly academic patenting and licensing and industry sponsored contract research and d) individual faculty consulting arrangements; e) entrepreneurial activities of alumni/students and researchers/faculty and f) standards. In recent new years, the latter channels have gained in importance as universities become more entrepreneurial. In addition, technological progress is transforming some of the traditional channels. Virtual networks enable greater collaboration between researchers and industry and the exchange and sale of intellectual property. Open access journals provide a complementary channel for diffusing scientific results while open research data initiatives which make underlying research available for further research or innovation represent a new channel for transferring knowledge. 8. New intermediaries for technology transfer have also emerged. University technology transfer and licensing offices (TTOs/TLOs) no longer have  if they ever did- a monopoly on commercialisation. IP intermediaries such as IP-based companies or government-backed patent funds are increasing their role in matching supply and demand for intellectual property from universities and chabadu chabados. The configuration and business models of TTOs are also changing. Many universities have sought to reform or replace the functions of TTOs, given their limited success, through the creation of regional hub- and- spoke TTOs that service multiple research institutions or the creation of privately funded and competitive TTOs. Some universities have expanded the missions of TTOs to include industrial relations in the broad sense (contract research, Public Private Partnerships etc.). Institutions are also exploring new approaches to IP ownership at universities such as vesting some rights with academic inventors to enable them to engage closer with industrial partners, while maintaining university ownership. 9. Among the drivers of these changes are global competition, the rising costs of scientific research and tighter government budgets as well as the evolving missions of universities which face   greater pressure for excellence in teaching and research but also in the their commercialisation and fund- raising activities. Indeed the Shanghai ranking of universities use commercialisation and financial indicators such as academic patents and endowments. 10. Yet despite the rise of new channels for knowledge transfer in most countries, institutions and policy makers are still focused on promoting the commercialisation mainly through patenting and licensing. However, with the exception of a few leading universities and government labs, patenting and licensing are, and will remain, a minor activity for most universities and PRIs, at least in comparison with other channels such as business research contracts and staff mobility. Surveys show that invention disclosures, that is the first official recording of the university invention, per USD 100 million per annum have stagnated over 2004-2009, but recent data indicates that levels picked up slightly for Canada (35 in 2010 to 41 in 2011) and less pronounced in the US (35 in 2010 to 36 in 2011). PROs in the UK (for 2004- 2010) and in Canada (for 2007-2011) perform better in terms of inventions disclosures than US institutions but significantly higher than in Australia and the rest of Europe. On average, PRO licensing income is still marginal compared to total research funding or expenditure at PROs. The average income as a percentage of research expenditure is 4.8% for the US (2004-2011), 2.2% for Australia (2004-2011) and 1.2% for Canada (2004-2011). 11. Initiatives at universities to foster student entrepreneurhip, such as training, mentorships, business start-up services, competitions, and an institutional entrepreneurial culture should be strengthened. Recent evidence points to the central role of students and alumni in commercialisation: they tend to be more prone than researchers overall to create and grow new companies, developing university innovation. Many of the spectacular successes from Silicon Valley can be assigned to this model. Student entrepreneurship is also being encouraged by universities and governments in many other OECD countries, including Germany and Sweden. 12. Open science and open innovation are increasingly influencing the commercialisation ability of universities and PRIs, as they provide new tools and new opportunities to both research and commercialisation. Open science emphasises the non-proprietary aspects of scientific discoveries and data, for making them available to a broader set of potential entrepreneurs. Open innovation attracts more firms to tap into the knowledge reservoir of universities and PRIs. But it also fosters a change in the way university research is undertaken and the way that academic intellectual property and know-how are managed and licensed or shared with the business sector (e.g. via new licensing and know-how sharing arrangements). 13. Financing gaps for the commericalisation of public research remain an issue and public funding for academic start-ups could be better complemented by skills and business services for academic entrepreneurs. Government support tends to focus on the pre-seed stage and later stage public venture capital support for high tech start-ups, but funding is also needed for proof-of-concept and demonstration projects to attract later stage funding. Success in commercialisation also requires training and skill development and the continued involvement of a variety of stakeholders, such as faculty inventors and mentors, students (who may also be inventors) and representatives from the business and investment communities (e.g. seasoned entrepreneurs and angel investors). 14. New financing tools such as IP collateralized funds and crowdfunding for research could potentially increase the amount of capital for commercialisation activities and enhance connections between scientists and society. Complementary and new source of funding such as IP-collateral based funding and crowdfunding represent additional sources of financing for university starts-ups, not just for operations but also for follow-on research such as clinical trials. But the scale of financing remains limited at the time being due to regulatory obstacles to crowdfunding in many countries. Another, and perhaps more important, effect of crowdfunding for research is that scientists are becoming more active  in   disclosing their ideas and promoting their research findings to potential investors and to society. At the same time, there may also be ethical concerns; researchers may be tempted to oversell their research outcomes in order to attract funding for example. 15. Comparable quantitative and qualitative indicators  mainly of patents and licensing revenue- of knowledge transfer and commercialisation are few and far in between. New metrics such as new registered trademarks, staff exchanges, student employment on funded projects, alumni in the workforce and services to external clients or the number of licenses from university or government labs that are actively used in commercialised products (i.e. a new metric used by the US Department of Defense). Yet, comparability, especially at international level, is still far away. 16. Given the multiplicity of channels for knowledge transfer, evaluations of public policies vary in focus and methodology, limiting international comparability. Most evaluations of commercialisation programmes have used economic impact/value added measures, either at the individual/firm/institutional/system level; only some have attempted to capture the non (quantitative)- economic impacts or/and indirect/intermediary impacts such as learning and improvements in human capital and research capacity, which are crucial for commercialisation, for example, at the firm level.	public research *** research organisations *** research organisations *** organisational innovations *** new products *** public research *** knowledge transfer *** public research *** commercialising knowledge *** contract research *** commercialising knowledge *** scientific publications *** intellectual property *** open access *** knowledge transfer *** technology transfer *** technology transfer *** intellectual property *** small and medium sized firms *** business models *** research organisations *** public private partnerships *** contract research *** scientific research *** knowledge transfer *** business research and development *** funded research *** commercialisation of research *** open science *** open innovation *** scientific discoveries *** open science *** open innovation *** intellectual property *** business sector *** public research *** service industries *** venture capital *** knowledge transfer *** international level *** knowledge transfer *** economic impacts *** commercialising knowledge *** public research results	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)22	DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TIP ACTIVITY ON THE INNOVATION POLICY PLATFORM (IPP)	2012	S	The Innovation Policy Platform (IPP) is a joint OECD-World Bank project that aims to collect together existing OECD, World Bank and national materials and to transform them into web-based strategic intelligence for policy-making and analysis. Expected users include policy makers and so-called policy-shapers  including various analysts, consultants, academics and stakeholders in STI policy processes  operating at the national, regional and sectoral levels in advanced, middle-income and developing countries. Such users have a range of needs, from looking-up a particular fact (e.g. statistics) through to seeking more extended support for innovation system analysis and policy design. TIP delegates and their organisations are likely to be important users of the IPP, as is the OECD Secretariat. Building the IPP involves ordering, synthesising, and linking together existing knowledge that is relevant to STI policy processes. The IPP packages this knowledge into synthetic web page texts, policy briefs, case studies and country profiles. It draws upon the OECDs and World Banks extensive statistical resources and links to relevant sections of existing published reports that are appropriately tagged. A web- based platform permits users to dynamically interact with the IPPs qualitative information and statistical data, thereby providing evidence-based support that is bespoke to their knowledge needs. Objectives and goals for the PWB 2013-14: develop an operational and sustainable IPP whose content and functionality are considered indispensable by the innovation policy community. This ultimate objective coincides with the following mid-term project goals: Launch a web-based platform during 2013 that will include many of the IPPs planned functionalities and a critical mass of content. Populate the IPP with content so that by the end of 2014, all initially planned modules are developed and country profiles for all OECD members are in place. Mainstream IPP content development across other TIP projects and the projects of other relevant working parties and committees. Foster strategic partnerships with other parts of the OECD, other international organisations, and national bodies in building and maintaining the IPP. Ensure the active participation of OECD member countries in guiding and contributing to the development of the IPP. This entails (i) Building the IT infrastructure has three main components: Building the semantic web IT infrastructure, Building the statistical plug-in IPP.Stat, Graphically designing the IPP web site so that it is visually attractive and easy to navigate, (ii) Content: development of modules (Innovation overview, policy and measurement: Definitions and fundamentals Public policy and governance Measurement issues; Innovation goals and outcomes: Economic growth, competitiveness and jobs, Green growth, Inclusive innovation for development; Innovation and firms: Innovative entrepreneurship, Innovation in established firms, Markets and competition, Intellectual property rights); Innovation inputs: Skills for innovation, Finance for innovation, Public sector Research and Development. Innovation connections: Networks and clusters, International linkages, Technology transfer). (iii) taxonomy and ontology: This is  a necessary step for tagging different bits of information in the IPP. This work will continue into 2013 and could form the basis for developing a glossary of innovation policy that could lead to internationally-agreed standards in the ways countries policies and governance arrangements are described and compared. The taxonomy is being built using the IPPs ontology as a framework, which is itself being refined as the taxonomy is extended. The central assumptions of this ontology are that a) activities can be distinguished that contribute to a countrys innovation performance and outcomes; b) activities are performed and shaped by actors who have interests and rely upon various resources; c) the resources and interests of actors are shaped by a range of institutional and structural influences that are often country- specific; and d) actors and influences also reside in an existing policy landscape that can have modulating effects on behaviours. This layered causal logic constitutes the backbone of the IPPs semantic ontology.	policy processes *** innovation systems *** support innovation *** policy processes *** economic growth *** public research sector *** green growth *** intellectual property *** innovative firms *** policy measures *** technology transfer *** governance arrangements *** countrys innovation performance	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)23	INNOVATION POLICY PLATFORM  PROGRESS REPORT DECEMBER 2012	2012	P	Work has got underway on developing a taxonomy of innovation policy related terms. This is a necessary step for tagging different bits of information in the IPP and is being carried out jointly by the OECD and World Bank, with the assistance of OECD colleagues working on the KIM initiative. The taxonomy is being built using the IPPs ontology, which is itself being refined as the taxonomy is extended. This work will continue into 2013 and could form the basis for developing an innovation policy glossary. The full list of IPP modules has been revised. The module on innovative entrepreneurship has been sketched out. The module on public policy and governance has also been sketched out. The IT contract for building the IPPs semantic web architecture has been awarded to REI Systems, a US-based company specialising in such systems. The initial list of IPP modules is as follows (1) Innovation overview, policy and measurement: Definitions and fundamentals, Public policy and governance,  Measurement issues;  (2) Innovation goals and outcomes: Economic growth, competitiveness and jobs Green growth, Inclusive innovation for development; (3) Innovation and firms: Innovative entrepreneurship, Innovation in established firms, Markets and competition, Intellectual property rights; (4) Innovation inputs: Skills for innovation, Finance for innovation, Public sector Research and Development; (5) Innovation connections: Networks and clusters, International linkages, Technology transfer	green growth *** intellectual property *** innovative firms *** economic growth *** public research sector *** technology transfer *** policy measures	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)3/REV1	REVISED DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TIP ACTIVITY ON CHABADA CHABADO	2012	S	despite the success of the NIS concept for policy making, the complexity of the grand challenges calls for new thinking on the future of innovation policy. Chabada chabado (SI) presents an interesting avenue of policy research for the TIP. Chabada chabado postulates that by  combining different types of innovation  incremental, radical and transformative - as well as changes in firms and organisations (e.g. workplace and social innovations) it could be possible to accelerate the transition towards greener growth. Examples include the introduction of greener mass transit systems that combine a number of changes, from regulation, infrastructure, general purpose technologies such as ICTs, workplace organisations (such as networked collaboration as opposed hierarchical systems), infrastructure management (such as those enabled by computing technologies), environmental monitoring (enabled by advances in remote sensing), or materials production (such as those made possible by green chemistry and nanotechnology). Chabada chabado implies systemic changes to socio-technical-economic systems (e.g. energy systems, public health systems) both in terms of the market, social values, behavior, and attitudes, technology (infrastructure, technology, tools, production processes) policy (regulations, incentives) and, most importantly, in the governance arrangements between the different stakeholders (firms, institutions, governments, citizens). Chabada chabado (SI) can thus be defined as a set of public policy interventions that can shift a particular socio-technical-economic system to a new more efficient and sustainable path through innovation. Chabada chabado implies a number of complementary changes on the demand-side, on the supply-side as well as in critical infrastructure. It also requires addressing the behavioral, technological, policy and business practices among the different actor in order to bring about system-level change. Chabada chabado often requires the transformation, replacement or establishment of complementary infrastructures and policy frameworks.  Work by the TIP could deepen the understanding of the elements of chabada chabado, the defining characteristics, the role of systems complexity, and help to identify the phases or tipping points where policy can change the trajectories of innovation systems, The TIP could also explore the role of technology platforms (TPs) in accelerating or shaping chabada chabado. Critical infrastructure for chabada chabado: While the government tends to be associated with critical infrastructure such as water and energy systems, in most OECD countries critical infrastructure for chabada chabado lies in the private sector (in particular the Internet). One important implication for chabada chabado is the need for public-private collaboration to enable systemic innovations. Research and innovation networks  defined as networks of innovation agents such as firm-based networks, networks of research institutions, etc are at the core of (national) innovation systems. One of the barriers facing policy makers wishing to transition an innovation system to a more sustainable path is that the present governance structures are not adequate due to short-termism in policy making, General research/policy questions regarding chabada chabado: How wide-spread are the complementarities identified at the core of chabada chabado? What systems are concerned? How big are they? What actors and linkages are more involved in the concerned innovation systems? What policy tools can be used to diagnose and identify tipping points for transitioning a system of innovation? What are the implications of chabada chabado for the design and enforcement of NIS framework conditions? In particular, for competition and regulation? What implications for funding of public and private research? Stakeholder involvement? What is the role of innovation networks in transitioning innovation systems from one level to another? What is the role of technology platforms in fostering chabada chabado and how can STI policies support them? How can and should the systemic nature of technology platforms, be reflected in the design and implementation of innovation policy and supporting measures? What lessons can be drawn for chabada chabado from the smart specialisation experience and analysis? In what respects do the two approaches relate to each other? What governance arrangements can be used to encourage chabada chabado? What lessons from sector innovation systems such as energy, agriculture? What role do general purpose technologies (GPTs) play in fostering chabada chabado?	systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** governance arrangements *** policy interventions *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** policy frameworks *** systems innovation *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** private sector *** systems innovation *** research organisations *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** governance arrangements *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** policy profiles *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** framework conditions *** business research and development *** stakeholder involvement *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** policy implementation *** smart specialisation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** governance arrangements *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** systems innovation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_global_challenges *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)4/REV1	REVISED TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TIP ACTIVITY ON INNOVATIVE PUBLIC- PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	2012	S	Public Private Partnerships (PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs) in research and innovation have become a main instrument of STI policy. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs help link supply and demand for research and innovation, complementing the innovation policy mix. On the supply-side, PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs offer a framework for the public and the private sectors to join forces in areas of research and innovation where they have complementary interests but cannot act efficiently alone. On the demand-side, PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs can help leverage private demand through public demand for the delivery of goods and services. In recent years, PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs have continued to expand in OECD countries as reflected in budget allocations and programme design. Data on the share of patent co-applications in triad patent families show a constant increase since the 1980. CIS data provide additional evidence of collaboration between public research and business firms in the area of Research and Development and innovation. In 1995 the OECD proposed the following definition of Public Private Partnerships as being: any formal relationship or arrangement over fixed-term/indefinite period of time, between public and private actors, where both sides interact in the decision-making process, and co-invest scarce resources such as money, personnel, facility, and information in order to achieve specific objectives in the area of science, technology, and innovation. OECD has identified eight criteria for characterising and categorising PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP: Modes of collaboration/partnerships, Type of actors, Area of application, Impact and indicators, Internationalisation, Finance and risk sharing, Governance, Policy rationale. A strong research and innovation policy discourse has emerged in recent years around the need to address global challenges and the role of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs in this respect. Recent years have seen a great deal of discussion on how PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs could be used to steer research agendas and to engage private industry in addressing the global challenges that affect not only social and economic problems of contemporary societies but also the future of humanity itself. This is part of a new trend in innovation policy that is more global in outlook and oriented towards addressing societal needs alongside the promotion of more sustainable economic growth paths. The international dimension of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP is yet under-developed but is gaining in importance in most OECD countries. In Europe, the Framework Programme of the European Union plays a catalytic role in the internationalisation of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP initiatives. What could TIP do in the area of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs? There are clearly many different possible PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP practices across different publicprivate mixes and the TIP activity would clearly needs to delimit the area of interest. Based on discussions at the TIP and comments received from countries, it is proposed that the activity take a thematic and functional focus as follows: Technology focus:  PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs are critical for key enabling technologies, Challenge focus: PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs for global and societal challenges (esp. healthy aging, green growth), Governance of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs for STI: PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs require specific governance arrangements, especially at international level. Some possible research questions/topics could include: To what extent are international PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs for Research and Development and innovation, in selected areas, shaped by national agendas? What new types of governance models exist for national or international PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs? What is the impact of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs on longer-term firm innovation behaviour and performance? How can policy makers or business firms engaged in selected types of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs avoid institutional or technological lock-in? What lessons can be drawn from the evaluation of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs?	public private partnerships *** policy mix *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** business research and development *** public research *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** global challenges *** public private partnerships *** global challenges *** economic growth *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** societal challenges *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** international level *** green growth *** governance arrangements *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** innovative firms *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)5	DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TIP ACTIVITY ON NEW FORMS OF IP MANAGEMENT FOR FOSTERING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION: GREEN TECHNOLOGIES	2012	S	As with other technologies, the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT system encourages investments in green innovation by allowing firms to appropriate returns from their Research and Development. But there may be particular externalities that are generated by green technologies which are welfare enhancing for society as whole, notably positive environmental externalities such as cleaner air and water as well as efficiency gains in energy production and the extension of natural resources. Green technologies also contribute to broader societal goals such as energy security and the preservation of biodiversity. Given the positive externalities and societal benefits from green technology, there is concern that the current rate of diffusion of such technologies may be slowed by a range of factors such as affordability and costs of technology, market imperfections, capital constraints and not least differences in INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT policies and practices between the public and private sector or between countries that may increase transactions costs and limit the diffusion of green technologies. as technology becomes more complex and draws on different sources of knowledge, the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT protecting the technology also relies on more than a  single patent or a single type of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT. For example, in the case of wind-power technology, the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs that protect the technology may include patents for the wind turbine; a copyright for software related to aerodynamics, generators and blade controllers; a design for the turbine; and a registered trademark for the brand. in cases where many firms own the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs embodied in standards for green technologies, this may create numerous practical problems for the diffusion of the technology. Among these are the co-ordination failures known as the tragedy of the anti-commons where competing IP rights prevent the diffusion and deployment of socially useful and affordable technologies. For these reasons, there is a need to re-examine how the current INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT system can better support the diffusion of green technology as well as to identify good practices for policy makers that contribute to the diffusion of green technologies in both the public and private sectors. the six potential areas for work in the area of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs and green innovation that could be carried out by the TIP. (1) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT standards and procedures: Incentives for developing technologies can be provided via lower patent application fees, prioritized and expedited patent examination, approval procedures and diminished standards in the area of green technologies. (2) Collaborative mechanisms in research partnership: It often involves model technology co-operation agreements that limit the potential of patent-related conflicts and encourage joint development. These agreements may be either ex-ante contracts (i.e., contracts for Research and Development) or ex-post contracts (i.e., contracts for existing technology). (3) Government policies to improve or ease access to INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT i.e. competition policy such as compulsory licencing, patent funds (Government backed patent pools and knowledge sharing platforms can be seen as mechanisms to ease or mitigate access barriers). (4) Patent landscaping and forms of information processing (Many of the basic approaches to solving the technological problems related to low carbon technologies are available off-patent, i.e. the patents covering these technologies have run their 20-year term and have expired. Green patent classification schemes are useful in this respect. Classification schemes can give quick and precise answers to the questions what is being patented?, where?, by whom? and for how long? The answers are important to governments, NGOs, industry, academic researchers and other stakeholders). (5) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs under government contracts (Another policy area draws on the relationship between procurement policies and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs). (6) Markets for green technology: Standards and patents (However, potential problems between patents and standards persists: patents ambush, refusal to license unrevealed patents, failure to agree on FRAND (fair,  reasonable, and  non-discriminatory), third party transfer without pass on of obligations towards Standard Developing Organisations (SDO) to name just a few); Market mechanisms for trading technology (Of increasing interest to policy makers are the mechanisms, institutions, platforms and intermediaries that could in principle contribute to increased efficiency and connectedness in trading technology); The strategic use of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT (As these energy systems mature, it will be important to observe how IP strategies evolve, and whether the emerging leaders rely on litigation and blockage, cross-licensing, or any one of the many corporate IP strategy variations identified. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs can also be used to attract venture capital, facilitate entry into strategic alliances, provide protection against litigation, and create opportunities for mergers and acquisitions). This TIP activity will result in a policy report on good policy practices for diffusing green technologies and innovations, providing guidance to policy makers on how to use the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT system and good INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT management practices to accelerate the diffusion of green technologies and innovations from the public research to industry and within and across sectors, including via global value chains.	green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** private sector *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** technology diffusion *** private sector *** good practices *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** technology co-operation *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** intellectual property *** policy areas *** green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** venture capital *** intellectual property *** green technology and innovation *** public research *** intellectual property *** policy practices *** global value chains *** green technology and innovation *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** fostering innovation *** green technology and innovation *** new forms of innovation *** technology diffusion	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)6/REV1	REVISED TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TIP ACTIVITY ON OPEN SCIENCE	2012	S	Open science has emerged as a term to capture policy and public interest in greater openness in science. While science has always been open and subject to open debate, the Internet and the societal push for greater transparency and accountability in government and public research institutions has increased calls for more openness in science. Although there is no standard definition of open science, there is an emerging consensus that open data, open access and  open research are central  elements  of  any  open science definition. There is also a general consensus among policy analysts and researchers that the scientific process itself is becoming increasingly data driven and dependent on information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs). In light of this ICT-led transformation of research, governments, research institutions and researchers themselves are adopting open science tools to promote increased access to and sharing of research data. Greater openness in science arguably allows greater participation in research, both domestically and globally, enhancing the quality and integrity of the science enterprise. Open science can potentially increase the societal benefits from public investments in research through: i) greater access to public research data, enabled by ICT tools and online platforms which could foster further research and innovation; ii) greater collaboration in science, including through the participation of non-scientists1 which could provide scientists with additional information and data; and iii) greater diffusion of scientific publications though the use of alternative copyrights. In addition, open science has the potential to improve relations between the scientific community and society. Despite the benefits, open science also raises important policy challenges. The first of these is ensuring the validity and quality of scientific data that is shared through the Internet and other online platforms. Open science also raises questions of security risks to society from the disclosure of certain scientific information that may be used to nefarious ends including terrorist activities. There are also substantial technical, legal costs and business models issues associated with making scientific data more accessible. As key funders of public research, governments play an important role in developing policies to foster greater access to and the use of scientific research. Many OECD governments are making efforts to strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as technical and human capabilities, to encourage open science initiatives. Critical policy issues in open science: In order to identify the barriers, opportunities and risks arising from open science initiatives, it should be noted that open science as a concept is linked to different open movements (e.g. open source, open data, open access, open research, open innovation). Each of these open movements provides the scientific community and innovators with new tools and opportunities to advance in science but also raises new policy challenges. It is proposed that work by the TIP on open science take a modular approach and explore the following areas related to open science: (i) Open data (Impact of open data on science and business innovation, Inter-operability of systems, Open data standards, Confidentiality and privacy issues) (ii) open access to scientific research results (Open access policies, Licensing arrangements, Incentives for researchers, Collaboration between public institutions and publishers)  (iii) open research and communication (Online platforms for science-science collaboration, Open peer review, Citizen science, Public trust in science through open research and open science).	open science *** research organisations *** open science *** open data *** open access *** open science *** research organisations *** open science *** scientific publications *** public investment in research *** open science *** open science *** open science *** business models *** public research *** scientific research *** policy development *** open science *** open science *** open data *** open access *** open innovation *** research results *** scientific research *** open science *** business innovation *** open data *** open access *** peer review *** research organisations *** open science	policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_open_science
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)8	SUMMARY OF THE SECOND WORKSHOP ON SMART SPECIALISATION FOR INNOVATION- DRIVEN GROWTH	2012	R	The synthesis report will:  Provide a conceptual framework and will explain the needs for a smart specialisation approach.  Serve as guidance on the assessment and design of regional strategies to promote smart specialisation and will collect the results and good practices obtained from the project.  Provide policy tools for an ex ante analysis and planning of regional strategies to promote smart specialisation.  Discuss the relevance, role and use of indicators, the lessons learned from the mapping of governance mechanisms in the governance profiles and the application of the self-assessment key.  The main policy areas that will be included in the synthetic report are:  Economic transformation: countries and regions are going through an economic transformation fostered by the new global conditions for innovation and growth, the world- wide geography of growth (e.g. clusters and GVCs) and the new sources of growth (intangibles, knowledge assets) and ITCs developments.   Governments transformation: the smart specialisation approach encourages a structural transformation within governments pushed by budgetary constraints and scarce resources. It promotes a higher empowerment of entrepreneurs in the identification of future market opportunities and to leave markets lead to the best exploitation of comparative advantages.  Regional strategies to promote smart specialisation: these strategies are presented as a broad policy mix of industrial, innovation, educational and entrepreneurship policies. The smart specialisation approach requires policy coherence and flexibility to adapt policies to the new continuously changing conditions. This policy approach promotes strategies that allow a better connectivity of capacities to increase reactivity to changing conditions.  Co-operative decision making mechanisms: Multi-disciplinary stakeholders involvement and multi-level governance interactions are essential in the decision making mechanisms.	smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** good practices *** smart specialisation *** policy profiles *** governance arrangements *** policy areas *** innovation and growth *** smart specialisation *** comparative advantage *** smart specialisation *** policy mix *** smart specialisation *** policy approaches *** stakeholder involvement *** smart specialisation	policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2012)9	SYNTHESIS OF THE GOVERNANCE ENQUIRY AND CASE STUDIES OF THE PROJECT ON SMART SPECIALISATON FOR INNOVATION-DRIVEN GROWTH	2012	R	76. The TIP-S3 governance enquiry illustrates that assessing governance mechanisms and outcomes in STI priority-setting and resource allocation is not an easy or straightforward task. For many countries, it still is in its embryonic lifecycle phase both from a policy development and deployment perspective. However, our survey also illustrates that countries, and even more so, regions, do increasingly engage in priority assessment and -setting in the areas of science, technology and innovation. Moreover, the survey also suggests that resource allocation as a function of priorities chosen may form a basis for novel and relevant indicator development geared towards capturing both specialization intentions and decisions. 77. The results of the survey further illustrate the increasing tangibility of those governance mechanisms and outcomes. They strongly underline the need to include a governance process assessment method into the toolbox that may underpin the design, deployment, follow-up and monitoring of smart specialization strategies. Therefore, (1) the questionnaire, (2) the survey method deployed and (3) the insights obtained with the governance template, jointly add value to the further development of a S3 policy design and process framework. 78. The current immaturity and fuzziness of the Smart Specialisation concept calls for new policy intelligence. According to the enquiry results, the following actions seem relevant and timely:    Development and testing of tools to conduct strategic analyses with the view to identify smart specialization niches (rather than broad activity domains, too similar across countries and regions);  Mutual learning and expert support to improve the stakeholders involvement process and the interlinkages between quantitative and qualitative inputs into strategy formation process;  Development of monitoring and evaluation systems specifically geared to S3 goals (in complementarity with generic systems, which need improvement);  Pilot exercises on implementing S3-oriented public budget pictures, as an effort to make the S3 concept more tangible.	governance arrangements *** resource allocation *** policy development *** resource allocation *** governance arrangements *** smart specialisation *** evaluation systems *** stakeholder involvement	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)10	COUNTRY CASE STUDIES ON STRATEGIC PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION	2013	R	10. Some of the common features can be summarised as follows:  Strategic initiative on a long-term basis with a clear goal;  Motives that increase efficiency, such as value for money;  Increasing synergies or impact generated from a partnership; and  Strong initiative by public sector rather than private sector. 11. Some differences can be found concerning:  Some of the strategic Public Private Partnerships use supply-side innovation policy instruments while other use a more demand-side approach such as regulation;  The IP policy in the Public Private Partnership is case specific, in some case more restrictive while in others more open for research use, or it may be jointly shared;  The amount of resources that are mobilised, i.e. grants, loans, matching fund, share of government funding varies from 50% to more than 85% in the case of Israelis incubator programme and;  The use of incentives such as tax credits or equity ownership.   12. Some of the insights from the case studies can be summarised as follows:  Governance mechanisms (i.e. co-ordinated decision making, risk-sharing and co-financing among stakeholders, self-assessment and independent evaluation etc.) as a whole play an extremely important role in success of a public-private partnership. Good design and management comprise the integral parts of a Public Private Partnership formation, which increases the probability of a success.  Large-scale, high-tech resources and infrastructure are great assets, which can be used for accelerating technological innovation through Public Private Partnerships. It provides common platform to efficiently stimulate collaborative activities with interested actors from industry, academia, and public research institutes; allowing them to save costs and time and generating synergies.  Intellectual property including foreground and background IP can be managed flexibly according to the strategic nature of a partnership. IP policy can be limited, or open to outsiders for the exploitation and dissemination of IP, or encouraged to be shared jointly with participants. Public Private Partnerships could use specialist groups to provide professional advice on IP management issues in the form of IP working party or IP committee under the Public Private Partnership governance structure.  Legal status and financial commitment are important components to the long-term sustainability of a partnership as illustrated by the EUs IMI case and Chinas SAITI public-private partnership.	public sector *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** research use *** public private partnerships *** intellectual property *** policy instruments *** tax incentives *** governance arrangements *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** public private partnerships *** governance arrangements *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)12	BASIC DEFINITIONS AND TERMS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION POLICY	2013	P	The overall goal is to standardise the definitions and classifications of policy-related terms. These include policies (e.g. their goals, instruments and processes), the activities policies are meant to shape (e.g. research, patenting, tertiary education, etc.) and their outputs (e.g. scientific articles, patents, skills, etc.),  the actors that perform these activities (e.g. universities, multinational enterprises, innovation agencies, etc.), and the factors that constitute the environmental context in which actors perform (e.g. market conditions, industrial specialisation, factor endowments, etc.). A first step is to agree upon an authoritative list of such policy-related terms and to define them. This will result in a controlled vocabulary of innovation policy-related terms, which can be continuously updated as the field evolves. Besides providing standard definitions, a controlled vocabulary may assign other attributes to terms, such as equivalent synonyms, preferred labels and/or translations into foreign languages. A controlled vocabulary is an agreed list of defined terms, and little more. The definition of these terms does not include any specific ordering or grouping of terms, for example. But many terms are at a higher / lower level than others and can be organised into hierarchies of broader / narrower relationships to provide a taxonomy of terms. For example, the term policy instruments is a broader term for fiscal incentives which in turn is a broader term for volume-based tax credits. Controlled vocabulary: the IPP has already assembled a list of 1,100 innovation policy-related terms for tagging content. Taxonomy: with such a long list of terms in the controlled vocabulary, the need to introduce some organisation to the contents will be irresistible. Ontology: for the project to realise its full potential, a variety of additional relationships and attributes should be specified for the terms and their classes. These include various causal relationships but also classifications beyond the hierarchical types developed for the taxonomy. Considerable flexibility exists on the scope and pace of this work.	policy instruments *** tax incentives	policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)13	BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THE TIP WORKSHOP ON OPEN SCIENCE AND OPEN DATA	2013	R	1. Information and communication technologies, new data storage infrastructure and large scale computing are modifying the way science and research are conducted, disseminated and diffused. On the one hand, the Internet and related online platforms are creating new opportunities to organise and publish the content of research projects, scientific publications and large data sets, so as to make it immediately available to other scientists, researchers as well as potential users in the business community and the society in general. On the other hand, ICTs allow the collection of large amount of data that can be at the basis of scientific experiments and research, contributing to make science increasingly data-driven. As a consequence, it is now possible to access, use and re-use research and scientific inputs and outputs (both articles and datasets) at free or extremely low marginal cost and speed the transfer of knowledge amongst researchers and across scientific fields, opening up new ways of collaboration and new research domains. This transformation of science into a more open and data-driven enterprise is often grouped under the term Open Science or Science 2.0. 2. However while open science creates new possibilities for research as well as innovation it also creates new challenges for policy makers who need to better understand the implications for policy making and the broader social and economic impacts. 3. This background paper sets out the key issues for discussion at the TIP Thematic Workshop on Open Science and Open Data, to be held on the 12th December 2013 at the OECD Headquarters in Paris. Each section of this note describes and highlights potential benefits but also risks associated to different aspects of open science and open data that will be discussed at the workshop. 2. The power of open and data-driven science for research and innovation 4. Open and data-driven science, especially big data, is changing the way science is carried out as it allows researchers to scale research through the use of algorithms, cloud computing and crowdsourcing of ideas and findings, including via citizen science. In addition, as science becomes data driven its social and economic value is enhanced. Just as business or government data are increasingly being used to create new goods and services, scientific data is enhancing the quality and output of scientific research. Open research data allows scientists in one field to exploit data in other fields and reveal relationships or patterns that were not visible before. It allows them to formulate and test new hypotheses and improve predictability of scientific models. 5. With respect to research, the power of open and data driven science lies in paving the way for a fundamentally different approach to science, with broad implications for the way academic research is funded and carried out, the infrastructure that is needed and the skills required. The new way of doing science is based on several building blocks, notably an ICT infrastructure of hardware, algorithms for exploiting large data sets, open source software and interoperability of operating systems, metadata, appropriate INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT arrangements and the sourcing of knowledge and data from the crowd via the Internet. Incentives and trust however remain important in this new eco-system for science (Figure 1).	scientific publications *** knowledge transfer *** research use *** open science *** open science *** economic impacts *** open science *** open data *** open science *** open data *** scientific research *** intellectual property *** open science *** open data	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)3_REV1	Chabada chabado: Concepts, dynamics and governance	2013	R	1. The TIP has embarked on a two-year project on Chabada chabado as part of the OECD Committee on Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP)s programme of work and budget for 2013-2014. The recent interest in chabada chabado or systemic innovation among policy makers and the OECD itself can be traced to several policy challenges. The first concerns the long standing issue of the effectiveness and efficiency of national innovation policies, especially in a context of increasingly globalised Research and Development and production systems. In most OECD countries, innovation policies aim to address market failures around investment in Research and Development in order to foster productivity and growth. But as noted in this report, the focus is often on increasing the number of innovative firms, i.e. the rate of innovation, with little regard to the direction of innovation outcomes or the distributional effects of innovation on economic growth. Indeed, there is some concern that economic returns from innovation are not only skewed within and between countries (i.e. due to first mover advantage, winner- take-all strategies), but that the downstream benefits from innovation are not diffusing broadly enough due to global competition and technological change that are making jobs more highly skilled, potentially eroding social cohesion and creating an innovation divide. 2. The second challenge that has brought chabada chabado to the fore is that of sustainability. Sustainability, however, is more than pricing environmental externalities in production processes. It also about safeguarding the environment and mitigating the effects of climate change and includes the protection of the earths finite natural resources, including biodiversity. Against a background of finite natural resources (e.g. oil, water, arable land) which for many years have fuelled economic growth, the future of OECD economies and of human civilisation in general is uncertain at best and by some accounts, outright bleak. 3. But a future of oil and water shortages and industrial decline is not the only path that exists. The OECD Green Growth Strategy tells us that, together with market mechanisms, technology and innovation can help us meet the challenge of sustainability and generate new sources of growth. Demand for renewable energy and changes in consumer behaviour are fuelling growth in new growth sectors such as electric vehicles, sustainable agriculture products. Indeed, advanced technologies in ICT and nanotech are leading to a renaissance in the manufacturing sector in many sectors, from electronics, medicine to consumer goods such as paints and cosmetics. Genomics and synthetic biology holds the promise to re- engineer living things or manufacture completely new products. 4. However, current configurations of large technology and innovation systems in areas like energy, food, transport, health may not deliver the change in growth models that are needed in time to avoid the bleak scenarios. This is why chabada chabado matters  to make the systems that underpin economic and human activity more resilient, equitable and sustainable for the future. Drawing on systems theory, an important characteristic of chabada chabado is that these socio-technical systems are complex and to a large extent self-regulating and self-correcting through feed-back mechanisms. But for various reasons (technology lock-in, market failures, governance failures, systems design, preservation logic, entropy) self- correction is either impeded or disrupted.	systems innovation *** systems innovation *** market failures *** research investments *** innovative firms *** economic growth *** technological change *** systems innovation *** economic growth *** green growth *** new products *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** market failures *** systems innovation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)4	THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY OUTLOOK 2014: DRAFT OUTLINE OF CONTENTS AND PRELIMINARY SCHEDULE	2013	O	For the 2014 edition, the Secretariat proposes to capitalise on the various changes introduced in 2012 and to consolidate overall quality of the publication. The analytical framework developed for, and applied to, the different components of the 2012 edition (databases, publication, profiles, portal and questionnaire) will be preserved. The needs and imperatives of the STI e-Outlook will be kept in mind from the beginning. New features may include: A new introductory chapter presenting overall trends in STI and STI policies together, as opposed to separately in previous editions, and serving as a storyline for the subsequent profiles. Consolidation of policy profiles around the same structure. Consolidation and refocusing of country profiles on national hot STI issues. Thematic chapters will be removed and may be issued as components of the newly created OECD Science, Technology an13 docd Industry Policy Papers series on an ad-hoc basis, possibly to be released twice a year in concordance with CSTP meetings. The STI Outlook 2012 gave particular attention to the mechanisms through which the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent public debt crises has affected and could further affect the innovation outlook and innovation policies. Building on these scenarios, the first chapter of the 2014 edition will explore the overall latest trends in STI and consider to what extent the era of budgetary austerity, that is spreading to some countries, may have altered national and global RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and innovation outlook. It will adopt a forward-looking perspective as much as possible to analyse shifts in innovation actors behaviours and strategies, volumes and orientation of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT efforts, gaps in science and innovation performance, public policy priorities and intervention. For that purpose, the development and inclusion of nowcasts of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT budgets will be considered. This chapter will be made of about 20-25 thematic policy profiles presenting cross-country comparisons of STI policy rationale, instruments, orientations and governance in the OECD area and beyond. 2014 policy profiles will essentially be the same as in 2012 and will be organised into the same structure (Table 2). New themes may include cross-border STI governance arrangements, risk governance through standards and regulations, public-private partnerships, industrial policies, in particular manufacturing policies, and innovation for social challenges. Some existing profiles, e.g. public research policy or building international STI linkages, may be expanded into several new profiles. The scope of some existing profiles may be extended too, e.g. the profile on commercialisation of public research may be expanded to transfers of private research results, and that of policies for emerging technologies will also cover converging and enabling technologies. This chapter will be made of over 40 country profiles which offer insights into national innovation systems and present recent important national innovation policy developments. The individual country profiles will present a general description of national innovation system and recent policy actions. They will tend to be more analytical than in the past and to focus on national hot STI issues, i.e. the three or four most topical issues discussed in national policy making circles at the time the STIO policy questionnaire is circulated, as they are seen as sources of risk or opportunities. Indicators-based diagnostic and analysis in the country profiles will emphasise these country-specific policy areas. In fact, the overall design of country profiles will be slightly adjusted and the selection of STI indicators may vary accordingly across country profiles.	policy profiles *** innovation performance *** policy profiles *** policy profiles *** governance arrangements *** public research *** public research *** research results *** business research and development *** national innovation systems *** policy development *** national innovation systems *** policy areas	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)5	OPEN SCIENCE: BACKGROUND AND PROGRESS REPORT	2013	R	1. Information and communications technologies (ICTs), from e-mail, to the Internet, the cloud and smart devices such as smart phones and tablets are impacting on the scientific enterprise in ways that few scientists, funding agencies, universities, businesses, policy makers or publishers would have ever anticipated. The advent of the Internet has pushed the marginal costs of online publishing near to zero. The costs of data storage and archiving continue to fall in line with Moores law. New advances in computer science are creating opportunities to organise the vast amount of data generated by public research and enable greater sharing and re-use. The key word that characterises this is change is greater openness in science, from the funding stages of public research, to the process of undertaking research, and access to results and finally openness in regards to the degree of interaction between science and society. 2. The basic model for the dissemination of government-funded research results relies on scientific journals. Researchers donate their copyright in exchange of publication in subscription-based and peer- reviewed journals which are then purchased by academic and research libraries and made available to the research community. The (rising) costs of journals and limited public budgets at libraries naturally limit the number of journals to which many libraries can subscribe, and hence the number of users of publicly funded research. The conventional and proprietary journal model together with associated copyright limitations on diffusion have been challenged by the arrival of Internet-based publishing and the ease of which information can be copied and duplicated. While the rise of open access publishing, which also relies on the transfer of copyright by authors, cannot be disassociated with the broader trend in knowledge networks and markets driven by advances in ICTs, a key difference is that open access in science operates at the intersection of public and private markets. Furthermore from the policy perspective, the design and effects of access policies mandated by universities and funding agencies are not independent from the role of both print and on-line publishers. The process of selecting, reviewing and publishing articles in open access journals is not cost free, even if it is less expensive to produce than conventionally published literature. In fact, most open access journals rely on subsidies or funding from universities, scientific societies and government agencies. 3. Arguments for more open and less restricted access to scientific articles and data include the increase to the stock of useful knowledge that is accessible to would-be users; the impacts on education and skills to the development of collaborative research networks; enhanced problem solving capacity by providing necessary supporting information; enable the provision of a range of social knowledge (e.g. in health care); and provide opportunities for the emergence of new firms and new industries. Greater access can also increase demand for market development of the software tools and information techniques such as data and text mining. These data analytic tools could be valuable use to funding agencies; improving their ability to set research funding priority based on detailed knowledge of research developments in specific fields (e.g. smart specialisation strategies). At a time of budget cuts and fiscal austerity in some countries, efficiency arguments resonate strongly with policy makers. However, in a competitive market economy, there will be limits to openness in science and innovation as firms and universities compete in the market for knowledge in order to differentiate themselves in the global marketplace. 4. Just as there are arguments in favour of more openness in science there are many questions concerning the risks and trade-offs in terms of quality, security and so forth. Open does not mean free and there are both opportunity costs and large financial investments required to make scientific articles and   data more open. How can open access and open data be made more sustainable through market-based mechanisms as opposed to public subsidies? How can quality be ensured? Some data from public research, like meteorological observation and geological surveying data exhibit strong public good characteristics with little risks to copyright infringement or to privacy rights. Other types of scientific data, including social and biological data have different attributes including different ownership and control mechanisms (e.g. patents). While the benefits of greater openness in science may outweigh the costs in the longer term, policy must be ready to adapt and even anticipate changes in technology and in the needs of the creators and users of publicly funded research. Policy will also need to balance competition goals with co-operation as both elements are important drivers for scientific progress on the one hand and innovation on the other.	funding agencies *** public research *** public research *** funded research *** research results *** funded research *** knowledge networks *** open access *** funding agencies *** open access *** open access *** collaborative research *** health care *** funded research *** funding agencies *** smart specialisation *** innovative firms *** open data *** open access *** public research *** funded research *** open science	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)6	PROGRESS REPORT ON THE PROJECT TO BUILD THE INNOVATION POLICY PLATFORM (IPP)	2013	P	Developing IPP content. The IPP contains several types of interrelated content, as follows: IPP webpages that provide summaries of topics and issues and that navigate users to OECD and World Bank reports and statistics. Existing OECD and World Bank reports, including conceptual and policy reports and country case studies. Existing OECD country profiles (from STI Outlook). Existing OECD STI Outlook innovation policy database. Existing OECD and World Bank statistics New IPP knowledge products, essentially IPP Policy Briefs and IPP Case Studies In addition, the IPP could also contain non-OECD and non-World Bank content, including  reports from national governments and other international organisations, such as the European Commission. While content is searchable in ways that are standard to websites, a key added value of the IPP is the manner in which content is organised and linked together on the site. This should allow users to readily navigate to topics of interest and provides options for seeing and exploring related topics. Accordingly, the IPPs content is organised along the following lines: By country, covering those countries that are members of the World Bank (this includes all OECD and enhanced engagement countries); By topic modules, covering the definitions and sites of innovation and the main conditions; By sector and general purpose technology modules, e.g. Agriculture, Nanotechnology, ICT; By hot topics, such as Smart Specialisation and Inclusive Innovation	smart specialisation	policy_area_smart_specialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)7	STRATEGIC PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN STI	2013	R	13. Initial discussions with steering group members since the launch of the activity at the December 2012 meeting have identified one specific area of Public Private Partnerships that has attracted attention in STI policy circles: Strategic Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) for Science, Technology and Innovation. In this context, strategic refers to a partnership which is more directed to a longer term and higher level goal such as competitiveness and/or grand challenges (i.e. sustainability, health, climate change) or to geopolitical concerns such as energy security, food security. In strategic Public Private Partnerships the relationship between public and private partners is characterised by the pursuit of strategic goals on a longer term basis in contrast to more intermittent and arms-length relationships between government and companies. In others words, the public sector actors whether government or public research are more than catalysts, they are actively involved at all stages of the partnership. 14. A second characteristic of strategic Public Private Partnerships is that of scale, either in terms of the capital investments or the range and number of partners. Large scale partnerships are more apt to promote systemic change as they link demand and supply side actors together. In contrast to traditional Public Private Partnerships that involve one-to-one relationships, these partnerships involve a multiple and diverse number of stakeholders (i.e. government, public research institutions, business firms, NGOs, foundations, customers, individuals), revolve around broad, emerging scientific fields, such as nanotechnology or genomics, are initiated by the government; serve a specific goal or challenge and are usually aligned with national and ministerial innovation strategies (e.g. re-industrialisation, Green Growth and Competitiveness Strategies).   15. The aim the TIP activity on Public Private Partnerships is therefore to identify new trends and good practices for Strategic Public Private Partnerships in order to propose a common framework for the design and evaluation of these strategic Public Private Partnerships in STI and with a view to enhancing international co-operation. Towards a working definition of Strategic PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPs for STI 16. The working definition of strategic Public Private Partnerships proposed is that of a large-scale, challenge driven Public Private Partnership that takes a value chain and systemic approach to technological and innovation development. Public Private Partnerships in this context are more directed towards global challenges and/or industrial policy and technological competitiveness goals and involve multiple partners on the supply as well as the demand-side (see Figure 1). Furthermore, Box 1 provides a range of OECD country examples which may be considering at fitting these criteria for strategic Public Private Partnerships	public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** private partnerships in sti *** public research *** public sector *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** research organisations *** green growth *** good practices *** international co-operation *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** value chains *** public private partnerships *** global challenges *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)9	SCOPING PAPER ON STRATEGIC PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION	2013	R	20. While the mapping exercise as well as first results of the country case studies carried out by members of the TIP provides valuable input [see DSTI/STP/TIP(2013)10], further information regarding the various parameters of strategic Public Private Partnerships still needs to be mapped and explored. 21. While the benefits and motives of actors to join strategic Public Private Partnerships are evident: they allow the co- financing of Research and Development and innovation efforts so that actors can reduce uncertainty and costs of projects, share skills, and increase their abilities to absorb and integrate external (technological) information and knowledge, among others, they are complex organisational arrangements that involve substantial risks. There are several barriers and transaction costs in large-scale and long-term project configurations, especially those issues related to governing, financing, co-ordinating, controlling and the sharing of results with the necessity to combine diverse competencies and disciplines. 22. In the same vein, monitoring on-going activities and measuring the impact of strategic Public Private Partnerships remains a significant challenge. In addition, although co-operation with foreign partners constitutes an important external knowledge source, government-sponsored innovation partnerships are in most instances only open to domestic actors or have requirements that make the Public Private Partnership less attractive to foreign-based partners. Another issue that is of concern to policy makers is increasing the involvement of chabadu chabados in strategic Public Private Partnerships for STI. These topics are discussed in the following sections. Governance of strategic Public Private Partnerships 23. In the context of this project, we refer to both policy governance as well as to the governance of the public-private partnership arrangements. Here, the former relates to policy frameworks (e.g. government oversight) as well as to the partnership specifications (e.g. rational and objectives of programme, target groups), whereas the latter defines the governance arrangements of the partnership (either formulated and stipulated in programme specifications or negotiated by partners at the outset of the partnership); in other words, it is important to make a distinction between governance of the political decision-making and the operation or implementation of the Public Private Partnership. 24. An important question is what type of governance programme arrangements ensure a strategic focus is maintained, especially for large scale and longer-term partnerships that involve multiple layers of governance? At a general policy level, those arrangements include the overarching legal structure of the partnership: is it governed purely by contract or does it include any equity components, such as minority investments by either party or the creation of an autonomous entity (e.g. a joint venture) in which each participant takes up a stake? Therefore, classifications have focused on how the relationships among partners are organised/governed and managed. Numerous proposals have been put forward for classifying governance structures, but some consensus has emerged into two basic categories differentiated by the presence or absence of equity (see Brouthers and Hennart 2007 for a comprehensive review of governance- mode decisions). An equity partnership refers to any exchange agreement in which the partners share or exchange equity, and includes agreements in which partners create a new entity as well as those in which one partner takes an equity interest in the other (Gulati and Singh, 1998). The second category involves contractual arrangements that cover a relatively large group of partnerships with no equity sharing, such as joint Research and Development agreements. 25. At the operational level, governance design encompasses specifications (e.g. information-sharing procedures and conditions that would trigger renegotiation of arrangements or penalties) and informal arrangements (e.g. non-contractual agreements and promises about commitments, inter-organisational liaisons, and flexible adjustments in the future).	public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** small and medium sized firms *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** policy frameworks *** governance arrangements *** public private partnerships *** joint ventures *** governance arrangements *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(2014)12	DRAFT SYNTHESIS REPORT ON CHABADA CHABADO	2014	R	22. A number of key policy implications can be drawn from the conceptual work and the case studies on chabada chabado undertaken for this project.  Among these are: 1. Policy makers should have a clear understanding of the systemic nature of problem and their role for instituting changes to the design of the system. They include architectural changes that affect the ability of the system to respond autonomously as well as its ability to be steered and coordinated, such as improvements in its internal cohesiveness and reductions in concentration. 2. As illustrated in several of the case studies, this also requires clear focus from the political leadership and the administration to effect change. 3. Transition management and participatory approaches can create shared visions and co-operation among actors but these processes takes time and require consistency or stability in policy direction. 4. Resistance to change can be conscious, purposeful and therefore adaptive. It can be adaptive both with respect to the strength of the impulse and to policy efforts to facilitate the transition. Understanding, and where appropriate, managing resistance, is a key role of policy. 5. There is a need for new administrative capabilities and new needs for co-ordination across government. Innovation policy making bodies need to become agents for change, leaders in conceptualising a vision and in steering, and facilitating learning across the system. Clashing with the interests of incumbents and their sometimes powerful lobbies requires quite a different mindset and capabilities from those usually encountered in an innovation agency. 6. Chabada chabado policy is predicated on accurate information about emerging opportunities and threats, the boundaries, structure, functions and performance of the system, and the monitoring of the impact of policy interventions. These are very resource intensive and imply a considerable upscaling of current intelligence gathering capacities in governments. This requires that transition programme managers are given adequate tools and incentives. 7. Policy interventions should be appropriately timed and sequenced. The very objectives of policy will vary. At an early stage the objective may be to identify and help co-establish a dominant design, whereas later on the objective may be to enable learning, and the accumulation of capabilities and of transition-specific social capital. 23. This report has shown that effective chabada chabado raises formidable policy and management challenges. While the case studies have provided insights on some of the key factors for success such as the role the importance of political focus and co-operation among various actors, there remain many unsettled questions regarding the process of scaling chabada chabado at local level to a national level or for establishing longer-term planning in policy making. There are also many trade-offs and compensation mechanisms involved in chabada chabado approaches. Further work on chabada chabado could extend our understanding of chabada chabado approaches by examining policies to support emerging technologies and industries in OECD member countries (e.g. Industry 4.0 initiatives) and green innovation initiatives	systems innovation *** transition management *** policy interventions *** systems innovation *** policy interventions *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** green technology and innovation *** systems innovation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI/STP/TIP(2014)15	STRATEGIC PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION - FINAL REPORT	2014	R	Public Private Partnerships in STI are increasingly used to promote science, technology and innovation 1. Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) in STI have become a particularly important tool in the policy mix of ministries and innovation agencies in OECD and non-member economies such as China, Russia and Malaysia. Broadly defined as collaborative research and innovation efforts that are carried out jointly, co- financed by public and private partners, and which may or may not be institutionalised in a designated entity, Public Private Partnerships in STI are distinct from contract research and development or public procurement of innovation. Relative to tax credits or subsidies, Public Private Partnerships are perceived as a flexible and adaptive instrument to foster collaboration in science, technology and innovation. Public Private Partnerships in STI are becoming more strategic; beyond the goal of linking science to industry 2. Public Private Partnerships in STI are not new and there is a long history of OECD countries providing incentives for firms and other actors to engage in co-operative research efforts. Among the first government initiatives were the so-called Collective Research Centres (CRCs), which were created in most European countries after the Second World War to stimulate the technological development of business in the major industrial sectors through collective and collaborative research (Wright et al., 2008). These have been driven mostly by a desire to turn research into socio-economic results. Today, policies to foster co-operation among actors represent a significant part of the portfolio of innovation policy support in many OECD countries and range from grants and vouchers to support co-operation between chabadu chabados and universities, Research and Development tax credits to spur collaborative research between industry and science (e.g. in France, Hungary) and industrial networks (e.g. Ireland, United Kingdom) to formal Public Private Partnerships. 3. In recent years, novel forms of Public Private Partnerships in STI, which appear to be more strategic, have emerged in OECD countries. Strategic Public Private Partnerships, in contrast to generic Public Private Partnerships and other collaborative support measures can be characterised by public support that is longer term ranging from more than 4 years duration. These Public Private Partnerships usually involve a minimum of three partners and tend to require large funding commitments from partners over the project lifetime. Projects outcomes are specified in a way to support pre-competitive non- generic research with the aim to address long-standing problems, generate new knowledge/technology with the strong potential to strengthen a countries industrial base, create employment and/or influence areas of strategic importance. Strategic Public Private Partnerships take a functional approach to meeting their goals 4. Strategic Public Private Partnerships tend to have a stronger top-down orientation and revolve around emerging scientific and technological fields, such as nanotechnology or manufacturing. They are usually aligned with national innovation and industrial strategies (e.g. re-industrialisation, Green Growth and Competitiveness Strategies). Selected examples include Chinas Industry-Research Strategic Alliances, Canadas Strategic Network Grants, the Netherlands Top Sectors, Germanys Innovation Alliances, Israels Magnet Consortium, and Frances Strategic Industrial Innovation Programme (ISI). 5. There is no single definition of what constitutes a strategic Public Private Partnership but a common characteristic the Public Private Partnerships covered in the TIP case studies is that function of the partnership is strategic such as  maintaining or achieving leadership at the technological frontier (e.g. the United States National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute). For other countries, the strategic function of the Public Private Partnership is to address the lack of core technological competences and long-standing problems involving the use and application of general purpose technologies for innovation (e.g. biotechnologies in health and ICTs in industry and services). In some countries, maintaining a comparative advantage in certain areas of innovation (e.g. Israels track record in generating high tech start-ups) is considered strategic from a functional perspective. 6. Case study evidence also indicates that these particular forms of Public Private Partnerships are also increasing in Asia in line with general economic development. Of interest in this regard is the series of Public Private Partnerships that have emerged first in Japan and more recently in Korea, China, Singapore and Malaysia. The strategic function in these cases has been less on the joint creation of new knowledge, than on the efficient dissemination of existing knowledge to firms that can utilise such knowledge for integrating into global value chains and competing on world markets. The drivers behind the rise of strategic Public Private Partnerships include the need for business to reduce risk and uncertainty in cutting edge technologies and for governments to achieve more from research investments at times of budgetary constraints. 7. There are several drivers behind the rise of strategic Public Private Partnerships in STI that go beyond the desire to link public and private research, or to orient public research closer to application fields, or to address deficiencies in financial markets that prevent firms from capitalising on public research. From the public side, the most important driver is the shift in STI policies towards addressing social, environmental and economic challenges. Many of the grand challenges exist in areas that lie in the public sphere or at the intersection of the public-private sectors. Examples include the delivery of healthcare; social services for ageing populations; sustainable transport, environmental pollution, etc. In this context, strategic Public Private Partnership in STI offers a way to harness the creative capabilities of the private sector to achieve productivity gains and service improvements. For business, the strategic Public Private Partnerships grant firms access to the tacit knowledge as well as research infrastructures in public research, helping to reduce technological and financial risks upstream (e.g. in the development of new materials for example). There are important principles for Public Private Partnership design and implementation. 8. Strategic Public Private Partnerships for STI may be a good way to address a complex challenge but they are themselves a complex challenge to establish, both for major investors such as governments and business as well as for actors directly involved in pursuing research and innovation activities. Literature on the evaluation of both traditional and strategic Public Private Partnerships and case study analysis reveal that the following principles are considered important for the design and implementation of Public Private Partnerships in STI: Project selection and design 9. Success of Public Private Partnerships in STI depends in no small way on the choice and design of the partnership. Well-designed partnerships between the public and the private sector can have clear and positive impacts. They provide efficiency gains in research and closer ties to application, and help partners manage technological and financial risks effectively. Misalignment of partner goals and timelines can be a barrier to successful partnerships. 10. Clarifying issues such as ownership, access, decision and control in the partnerships is important. New tools such as the visualisation of contractual information in contracts can help reduce friction and avoid contentious conflict later in the partnerships. However, as contracts and agreements are by nature incomplete due to information asymmetries, allowing for terms of renegotiation is important. An additional challenge is that many of the selected partners will naturally be incumbents or come from existing  industries, raising the risk of clientelisme. In this context, encouraging the participation of new young firms in public-partnerships, including through grants and prizes is important. Eco-system and value-chain perspective 11. By design or by lack of awareness and foresight, Public Private Partnerships often miss opportunities for integrating cluster dynamics and a value-chain approach. Integrating technological roadmaps and regional/cluster foresight in partnerships can help identify opportunities for broader application of research and technological outputs from the partnerships. Public finance 12. A variety of financing sources can be mobilised based on the nature of partnerships and the level of risk associated. On the government side, grant schemes are the most common financing mechanism in Public Private Partnership programmes. A conditional grant can help to prevent or mitigate moral hazard, which might occur under a collaborative programme. Conditional grants can impose detailed quality-related performance requirements. But compliance is costly to monitor and difficult to measure. Private finance 13. The provision of equity or debt finance by the private sector explicitly builds into the Public Private Partnership a mechanism for managing the cost of funds and associated risks. This is in contrast to public sector funding where project risks can be transferred to tax payers or end users. Private finance also brings effective management tools against the risk of additional capital needs arising from unforeseen changes. However, excessive shifting of risk to the private sector will require private partners to build up reserves to meet them, thereby potentially reducing their incentives to participate in the Public Private Partnership. In general, a well-established financial and business infrastructure (re-insurance, contract resolution and renegotiation) plays a catalytic role in increasing the success of the partnerships. Governance 14. Successful Public Private Partnerships require strong governance arrangements, especially when they involve a wide number of actors. Governments can act as leader and orchestrate processes in support of the overall goal of the partnerships. Complex and strategic Public Private Partnerships may also require the commitment and active involvement of more than one ministry to achieve desired outcomes. Therefore, aligning the various goals of different government ministries is important and may require not only adjusting incentives but even some restructuring of functions within ministries. Managing Intellectual Property (IP) 15. The establishment of contractual mechanisms that define knowledge and IP sharing, including access to research data and infrastructure, during and after the partnership, are crucial for the success and longevity of such collaborative arrangements. Sharing of intellectual property rights in Public Private Partnerships is a common tool but more so in upstream research processes rather than in downstream commercialisation. In fact, the assignment of exclusive residual rights to the private sector provides incentives for firms to continue to control costs in the development of new technologies throughout the partnership. In the absence of residual rights, a private firm would tend to under-invest. Openness to participation 16. Small and medium-sized firms face particular difficulties in connecting with other actors in innovation eco-systems given the shortage of finance, co-ordinating costs, legal costs of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT arrangements  etc. Because of their diversity - some chabadu chabados are closer to research, while others are closer to commercial activities - they can play an important brokerage role in translating high level government objectives and the commercial objectives of larger firms. Participation of chabadu chabados in large scale and strategic STI partnerships can also expand their networks, improve brand name recognition and enhance access to financing. A key issue for innovation policy concerns heterogeneity among chabadu chabados and ensuring effective targeting of participation schemes. Internationalisation 17. International Public Private Partnerships have increased in the context of cross-border EU programmes (FP7, Horizon 2020) whereas national Public Private Partnership programmes tend to be focused on national actors. At the same time, private foundations (e.g. Gates Foundation) are establishing international Public Private Partnerships around global challenges like health. Differences in legislation, rules and procedures for Public Private Partnerships in OECD and non-member countries may make the establishment of cross-border Public Private Partnerships difficult at best given the lack of standards. These differences make the management of Public Private Partnerships in the STI area more complex than in other areas and deserve particular attention from policy makers. At the EU level, where the scale of investments required for certain large projects is beyond the means of individual member states, Public Private Partnerships represent a promising approach to research and innovation policy. Public Private Partnerships in fact feature prominently in the toolbox of Horizon 2020 programmes. Evaluation and impacts 18. Complete and independent evaluation is important in the area of government policy interventions. There is a political need to know what leads to success or value added. In terms of approaches to evaluation there is a trend to focus on performance indicators but this raises the issue of how to capture the complexity of partnership models when most performance measures presume a linear model of innovation. The evaluation of Public Private Partnerships requires new perspectives on the additionality of government funding to supplement the traditional private-social returns model. New thinking in evaluation places a greater focus on building new capabilities and new networks which break out of sectoral and supply-chain patterns, and on how partnership modifies behaviour to create persistent effects. Indeed, in the STI area, value for money may not always be the main criteria for evaluating the impact of Public Private Partnerships; improving health or the environment, creating new knowledge, human capital building or building new networks may be equally important impacts. Such a shift in mind-set also calls for new indicators and metrics. The US Manufacturing Extension Programme for example is using both qualitative as well as quantitative metrics. In addition, it is also difficult to distinguish the effects of a Public Private Partnership from the effects of other policies to the extent that most actors are probably engaged in multiple policy interventions (e.g. Research and Development tax credits). Conclusions 19. In conclusion, the space in which Public Private Partnerships operate is one where neither government nor the private sector can achieve their objectives without the active participation of the other. In todays innovation policy landscape, characterised by globalisation, the extension of innovation policies beyond Research and Development and technology, there is a need for co-development of knowledge in a partnership which stretches into areas which traditionally have been the sole territory of either the public or the private sector. In fact, the public sector is also innovating and mutual learning could help both firms and governments address internal deficiencies in meeting social and global challenges. The existing literature on Public Private Partnerships in STI and the case studies annexed to this report [DSTI/STP/TIP(2014)15/ANN) suggest the following key issues are important in designing strategic Public Private Partnerships: 1. Co-ordination across different ministries and individual STI policy instruments can:  shape interdepartmental innovation governance; and   help align Public Private Partnership goals and instruments based on priorities. 2. Inclusive governance of partnerships  New modes of governance that share the leadership and oversight between representatives from industry, public research and government can help maintain commitment from stakeholders. 3. Adaptability of partnerships should be ensured to reflect changes in framework conditions, policy landscape or policy priorities and:  set the phase of commitment  help mitigate the bureaucracy in management 4. Financial sustainability is important for the success of Public Private Partnerships. It is important financing can  incentivise participants to achieve the goals;  develop clearer measures of outcomes to justify investment;  stimulate adaptive efficiency which targets the enhancement of technological superiority and the sustainable economic growth, rather than allocative efficiency of existing resources. 5. Evaluation of Public Private Partnerships in STI is difficult but important. Some tools that can improve relevance and impact include:  Regular monitoring;  Ensuring evaluation techniques match policy objectives;  Using multiple methods to increase the reliability of evaluation;  Longer-time horizons;  Assessing the social, technological and economic impacts, including human capital.	public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** policy mix ***

DSTI/STP/TIP(2014)4	CASE STUDIES ON CHABADA CHABADO: POLICY RELEVANT FINDINGS FROM THE BERLIN WORKSHOP	2014	R	36. In the final session, the discussants tried to follow up on issues of systematic barriers, the role of entrepreneurs, socio-technical innovations, governance, indicators and implications for innovation policies. It was decided to start the synthesis report with a chapter on definitions and basic concepts. The second chapter will be devoted to the dynamics of chabada chabado, in which transition management, infrastructure, technology and scaling up chabada chabado play a central role. Governance and policy action will be topics of chapter three, while chapter four will deal with implications for STI policies. This will then address the new role for governments, policy tools and indicators for systemic policy analysis. The case study summaries will be provided in the fifth chapter. It was suggested to rephrase the term tool box, as it might distract from the actual difficulty of implementing chabada chabado. In addition, it was suggested to connect the role of government from chapter two with chapter three, as it serves more functions that just that of a networker. As to the indicator part, there was a wish to focus on requirements and functions of indicators to get a better idea of measurement. It was also suggested that international drivers need more attention. Ch. 1. Definitions and basic concepts Ch. 2.

DSTI/STP/TIP(2014)9_REV1	MAKING OPEN SCIENCE A REALITY - FINAL REPORT	2014	R	1. Open science commonly refers to efforts to make the outputs of publicly funded research results more widely accessible in digital format to the scientific community, the business sector or society more generally. Open science is the encounter between the age old tradition of openness in modern science and the tools of information and communications technologies (ICTs) that have reshaped the scientific enterprise and require a critical look from policy makers seeking to promote long term research as well as innovation. 2. On the one hand, the Internet and online platforms are creating new opportunities to organise and publish the content of research projects, scientific publications and large data sets, so as to make them immediately available to other scientists and researchers, as well as potential users in the business community and society in general. On the other hand, ICTs allow the collection of large amounts of data and information that can be the basis of scientific experiments and research, contributing to make science increasingly data-driven. As a consequence, online repositories and archives offer the possibility to store, access, use and re-use research and scientific inputs and outputs (both articles and datasets) and speed the transfer of knowledge amongst researchers and across scientific fields, opening up new ways of collaborating and new research methods. This evolution of science into a more open and data-driven enterprise is often grouped under the term open science. 3. The term open science was first coined by economist Paul David (David, P.A. 2003) in an attempt to describe the properties of scientific goods generated by the public sector and in opposition to the perceived extension of intellectual property rights into the area of information goods. Economists consider scientific knowledge generated by public research as a public good, which means that everyone might make use of that knowledge with no additional cost once it is made public, generating higher social returns. This thinking is not altogether new. As far back as 1942, Robert King Merton, an American sociologist of science, described a set of ideals that characterised modern science and to which scientists are bound. First and foremost is the notion of common ownership of scientific discoveries, according to which, the substantive findings of science are seen as a product of social collaboration and are assigned to the community. Scientists claims to intellectual property are limited to recognition and esteem1. The race to be the first to claim recognition  the so-called priority rule  in science has traditionally been a strong incentive for scientists to make their knowledge public. 4. While this ideal-based system has functioned in part through the current system of peer review and subscription-based scholarly publication, the ICT revolution has shaken, if not the underlying ideals, at least the system of scientific production and diffusion. Open science in the information age espouses the notion that knowledge created from public research has public good characteristics that go beyond the concept of the commons developed in the 18th century, in so far as ICT enabled access broadens the possibilities to enrich the commons and extend it to a broader range of users. In recent years, open science has become an active area of policy development, both within the OECD and beyond. More than half of the countries who responded to the 2014 OECD Science Technology and Industry Outlook questionnaire, indicated open science as an area where major policy developments were implemented in the last two years. This report aims to provide an analytical overview of recent open science policy trends, by focusing in particular on those initiatives to promote broad access to publicly-funded research results, including both scientific publications and research data.	research results *** business sector *** open science *** funded research *** open science *** scientific publications *** research use *** knowledge transfer *** open science *** open science *** public sector *** intellectual property *** public research *** scientific discoveries *** intellectual property *** peer review *** public research *** open science *** policy areas *** open science *** policy development *** open science *** policy development *** research results *** open science *** scientific publications *** funded research *** open science	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science
DSTI/STP/TIP(2016)1	HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND PLACE-BASED POLICIES FOR THE KNOWLEDGE TRIANGLE	2016	R	1. Higher education institutions play a critical role in national innovation systems. In the past, neither public policy nor the higher education institutions themselves have tended to focus strategically on the contribution that they can make to the development of the regions where they are located (OECD, 2007). Indeed, in many countries, higher education and research funding policies are spatially blind. This is now changing as policy makers recognise that geographic distribution of knowledge production and its application is a critical factor that underlies the globalisation, as well as the localisation, of economic activities and hence sources of growth and well-being. 2. Analysis of the geographic distribution of innovation and skills across countries reveals that both are concentrated in a few core regions. This may reflect long term historical economic and technological specialisation patterns. This concentration of skills and innovation expresses itself regardless of the level of development or of the overall innovative performance of national economies. Given the high concentration of innovation activity across and within countries and the diversity of local innovation environments, it is not surprising that policy makers are increasingly devoting attention to place-based approaches, trying to promote innovation-led economic growth as a way to contribute to local economic development and well- being. These approaches often aim to strengthen the linkages between research, education and innovation at the local level that is what in this paper is called the knowledge triangle at the local level. 3. Higher education institutions, together with public research organisations, are clearly central actors in the regional innovation systems: they underpin the development and diffusion of education, research and innovation activities at the local and regional level. However, even when regional innovation policies have targeted higher education institutions, the focus has been on engaging their contribution to science-based innovation, just one side of the knowledge triangle (EC, 2011). The analysis of the recent trends to promote knowledge triangle dynamics at the local level highlights the following preliminary conclusions: - HEIs primarily participate in knowledge triangle initiatives at the regional and local level by interacting with other key actors such as regional development agencies, the business sector, and citizens who are increasingly involved in education as well as open science and open innovation. Private non-profit actors are also important components of local knowledge triangle interactions in some regions. - New governance mechanisms are emerging to embed HEIs in the local context. This can take different forms: from ad hoc governance bodies to co-ordinate HEIs at regional level among themselves and with regional governmental agencies and the business sector, to explicit regional innovation strategies. This second aspect is for instance emerging in European regions due in part to the EUs specialisation policy towards the regional structural funds. - Some countries are adapting and diversifying national innovation policy according to the local context. Given the high diversity of local knowledge triangles (urban vs. rural, level of development of the regions, level of absorptive capacity of local firms), it is important to diversify or adapt the innovation policy mix according to the local context of both the HEIs and the local innovation eco-systems. This is for instance the case of new or existing cluster policy programmes and open innovation platform initiatives.   - In innovation-intensive regions, local government and local actors are promoting initiatives going beyond the more traditional knowledge triangle approach to encourage new participatory forms of innovation, often focused on social challenges and engaging non- profits alongside start-ups and existing business firms.	higher education institutions *** national innovation systems *** higher education institutions *** funded research *** higher education *** education and research *** specialisation patterns *** innovation performance *** economic growth *** knowledge triangle *** research organisations *** innovation systems *** development and diffusion *** higher education institutions *** regional level *** innovation activities *** knowledge triangle *** higher education institutions *** business sector *** knowledge triangle *** open science *** open innovation *** knowledge triangle *** governance arrangements *** business sector *** regional level *** policy mix *** open innovation *** knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** higher education institutions	policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2016)10	THE KNOWLEDGE TRIANGLE: DRAFT SYNTHESIS REPORT	2016	R	Enhancing the contributions of higher education and research institutions through the knowledge triangle framework The Knowledge Triangle is a common frame for different policy frameworks that aim to transform universities 1. The knowledge triangle (KT) is an overarching policy framework for different theoretical concepts in science, innovation and higher education policy which in one way or another call for an integration of education, research and innovation activities and policies. Variants of this framework, some of which take an actor focus rather than an activity focus, include the triple helix (government- industry-university) put forward in the early 2000s by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorf (2000) who concluded that the university model is changing towards an entrepreneurial model which stresses the application and exploitation of research. The quadriple helix (government-industry-university-civil society) further expands this model by involving civil society in the agenda setting of institutions. The entrepreneurial university model takes both an actor and functional focus (entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurship and commercialisation activities such as university-based start-ups and patenting activities). Finally, the civic and challenge-driven universities are extensions of the triple helix model as they try to institutionalise the innovation focus of universities, both in the teaching and research functions (project-based learning and problem solving, use of MOOCs) but also with regard to the engagement of universities with their local communities. it implies a departure from the traditional view of knowledge production as a linear and sequential process 2. A central idea behind the KT framework is that creating new knowledge from research and high quality education are in themselves not sufficient to improve social well-being and economic growth (Stam et. al, 2016). In contrast to linear pipeline model of innovation, it emphasizes linking the different functions of HEIs together with the different actors in the surrounding innovation eco-systems (i.e. a place-based dimension). In doing so it recognises the explicit role of education and entrepreneurship in the development and application of research and education to solve specific societal problems in place-based context, whether urban poverty, public health or the needs of local industries. The KT framework encourages mechanisms to link education to innovation via entrepreneurship for example; and to link innovation to education and research for example by permitting professors of practice from industry to lecture at universities. Knowledge flows in the knowledge triangle are therefore not unidirectional. Innovations in business can fuel basic research just as innovation and entrepreneurship can feed-back into education. The knowledge triangle concepts are well understood by policy makers but the focus should now move to implementation a wider scale 3. Even if the concept or terminology of the knowledge triangle is fluid and varies across countries, regions and institutions, it is very much a practical and flexible framework that is being applied in many universities in OECD countries in the EU but also in Canada, the United States, Australia, Chile, Japan, and Korea and in non-member economies such as China and Malaysia. But in  many countries the institutions that are implementing the KT practices remain marginal in relation to the thousands of higher education and research institutions in OECD countries. In fact, despite the rhetoric around broader engagement, the reality is that increased investment in university research over the last 15 years or so has mainly led to a growing number of scientific publications and a global competition for scientific excellence (OECD 2016) At the centre of the KT are higher education institutions (HEIs) and public research institutions (PRIs) 4. Higher education and public research institutions are the centre of efforts to promote the knowledge triangle. As the share of higher education expenditure on Research and Development (HERD) in total public research has increased steadily over recent decades in the OECD area, as the share of government expenditure on Research and Development (GOVERD) has declined (Figure 1.1). Much of the government funding that is dedicated to public research is spent by HEIs (Figure 1.2). 5. The rise in higher education Research and Development is associated with a concentration of research within countries as well; only a small percentage of universities carry out the majority of the research (Figures 1.3 and 1.4). This concentration has been accelerated, in some countries such as Denmark, the UK and even France by the mergers of public research institutes into higher education institutions (OECD, 2016). Such universities often have a considerable degree of autonomy in how they balance and implement their missions, which is influenced by both their size and relative wealth, factors that vary enormously even within individual countries. Furthermore, innovation in firms increasingly relies on the science base that is generated at HEIs as illustrated by the proliferation of public-private research partnerships, contract research, industry funding of higher education, industry-university collaboration (Figure 1.6) and science-patent linkages (see DSTI/STP/TIP(2016)12). 6. Concentration may reflect a combination of factors related to size and scale. There are framework factors to take into account, like the size distribution of cities; and some economic ones like reputation, which is extremely skewed. Policies can play in both directions, concentration or equality but also government policies, such as performance-based contracts and increases in research funding relative to education; co-location of industry near HEIs and PROs; and institutional policies such as the recruitment of star faculty to attract additional funding for students, research and business collaboration.	higher education *** research organisations *** knowledge triangle *** policy frameworks *** education and research *** higher education *** knowledge triangle *** policy frameworks *** innovation activities *** new knowledge *** economic growth *** model of innovation *** education and research *** education and research *** knowledge flows *** knowledge triangle *** basic research *** knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** higher education *** research organisations *** education and research *** higher education institutions *** research organisations *** scientific publications *** higher education *** knowledge triangle *** research organisations *** higher education *** public research *** public research *** higher education *** education and research *** higher education institutions *** research organisations *** higher education *** science base *** innovative firms *** contract research *** business research and development *** funded research *** business research and development *** knowledge triangle	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** factors_underlying_observed_changes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2016)16	SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION: CASE STUDIES	2016	R	Innovation policy instruments remains focused on the novel and technological but this is starting to change with the integration of systemic, social and user-perspectives 2. A key message that emerges from the case studies is that even if innovation policy tools by and large remain focused on the novel and technological aspects of innovation to promote system-wide change, without adequately reflecting the social and user needs, this is starting to change as innovation agencies and ministries experiment with new modes of stakeholder engagement, longer-term programme funding and bottom-up programme design. The traditional weak focus on societal aspects in innovation policy design results not only from the under-development of policy tools to deal with complex socio-technical systems but also from the prevailing view that the science and technology-push model of innovation remains a solid basis for STI policy making. 3. However, without expressively targeting the social and user aspects, innovation policy inherently limit its impacts on socio-technical systems. The social and organisation innovations (e.g. business models) for example, must be combined with the technological ones to make production and consumption more sustainable. In this sense, the case of Belgium represents a good example where a new methodology and process for roadmapping was established with the clear recognition of the social aspects of socio-technical systems so that the starting point for roadmapping from a systems perspective is not the technological perspective nor the capability, but rather the market and end-users. The Portuguese example makes the case that experimental support programmes should go beyond technological objectives and projects should also be evaluated in terms of the degree of contribution to (sustainable) transformation goals they are able 1 The final case study from China is not yet available therefore the summary of this case study will be included in the final publication of the case studies in early 2017. The complete set of country case studies will be available from the OECD's Innovation Policy Platform (www.innovationpolicyplatform.org).  to induce. The Japanese case study also points out that nurturing human resources with skills and capacities is necessary as is integrating the technical and societal dimensions of smart cities. Building up participatory governance and process is one way countries are integrating user needs 4. One of big challenges facing policy makers wishing to promote the transformation of socio-technical systems is how to develop a shared vision among actors and to co-ordinate various actions and interests in the right direction. As the Austrian case study makes clear, even the actors who might be most affected by systemic change tend to be unaware and, thus, poorly prepared for such transformation. This implies that the resistance from incumbent players could be strong if there is a lack of consensus or lack of attention to a trust building process. Participatory governance to overcome communicative barriers can be built up at multi-level (e.g. international, national, regional) to encourage the participation of all stakeholders as illustrated by the example of Austrias Industry 4.0 platforms. In the Netherlands, broad consultation and a decision-tree framework was useful to assess whether or not the government should regulate new digital platforms. Similarly, the case study of the United Kingdom on low carbon vehicles illustrated the importance of getting the right senior level involvement from business and research institutes engaged with the road mapping exercise to ensure that the results were credible and represented an industry-wide view. The case study also points out that the roadmapping exercise could be improved via greater engagement from universities and research funding bodies regarding the major challenges for future low carbon vehicle research, particularly for disruptive technologies at early stages. In the case of Swedish Strategic Innovation Programme, the programme is organised with a profound bottom-up ambition in which design as well as implementation is decentralised to the participants of respective consortia with as little involvement of the agency as possible. The case shows that bottom-up approach of the overall programme appears to result in a diversity of responses to chabada chabado barriers. 5. Furthermore the participation of end-users is crucial as illustrated by the case studies of Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan and Sweden. In the Belgian case, employing a backcasting approach (i.e. the desired future state is stipulated up front rather than derived from scenarios or forecasts) was very instrumental to identify where the transition or transformation of the system was held back. In this case, the approach identified barriers to the uptake by end-user sectors of biobased products which helped the policy makers to implement measures to address them. In the Japanese case study, despite the co-operation between large technology companies and the local government and communities, the active participation of end- users in cities is also needed. The Swedish case study on the Bioinnovation programme pointed to the importance of active and prominent involvement of users for ensuring the market relevance of innovation projects. On the other hand, the case study also points out there are limits to understanding end user needs, especially in the case of radical innovation projects for which even lead users do not have a specified demand. Systemic policy instruments can help embed learning processes among innovation actors 6. Some of the case studies provide insights on how policy learning can be strengthened via systemic policy instruments. In the Belgian roadmapping case, the backcasting exercise was also a mean to promote learning by doing in the development and use of a backcasting methodology to technology roadmapping. As the UK and Russian case studies showed, roadmapping can be a process to encourage learning by gathering the collective knowledge and sharing the vision among stakeholders. In the Korean case, technology demonstration of autonomous vehicles provided an opportunity to diffuse learning among the public. The Portuguese case study on ocean energy highlights the relationship between policy experiments and policy change with focus on policy learning; this amounts to translating the lessons learned from experimental projects into lessons for policy change or vice versa. The Netherlands' framework for assessing the new to regulate new industries as an exercise in learning for policy makers and revealed a need for updating and clarifying existing regulations. A key lesson that policy makers must  take an iterative approach to policy learning by feeding back the results of experiments to strengthen learning especially, in case of the development of new framework and methodologies, as in the Swedish and Belgium cases. Better alignment of policies for better effect 7. No single innovation policy instrument can make sufficient impact on the transformation of socio-technical systems without being adequately aligned with other instruments. Though most case studies have taken a focus on individual policy tools (e.g. innovation project funding, technology roadmapping, cluster policies, demonstrators), they also illustrate how certain instruments are designed and implemented in a co-ordinated way with other instruments. For example, the demonstrator of autonomous vehicles in Korea was a means to diagnose the existence of regulatory barriers and gaps in the infrastructure. The UKs technology roadmap for low carbon vehicles also aligns itself with other innovation policy instruments such as demonstrators, public procurement and consumer incentives. The Swedish case study showed that public procurement was an important part of the policy mix to foster system change as it helps sustain demand for alternative technologies. Intergovernmental committees and platforms are typically used for the coordination of multiple policy instruments. The implementation of the policy-mix needs to reflect the system level conditions, not in a linear but rather in a systemic approach as illustrated by the example of Portuguese ocean energy system. In this case, it is clear that different stages of system transitions require different policy solutions. The Netherlands case also illustrated that regulations in one sector may have an effect in another sector so consideration of broader effects of regulation should be anticipated ex ante. Encouraging new entrants and entrepreneurship is at the core of system transformation 8. New enabling technologies, firms but also new business models often emerge at the niche level and can challenge or interact with established technologies, firms, business models, instruments and standards at the regime level. In this sense, the Japanese case study points out the importance of the creation and liberalisation of energy markets in encouraging new entrants and entrepreneurship. The case also shows that standard setting needs to be carefully managed to facilitate connectivity among the existing technologies while paying close attention to emerging technologies in related fields. The Dutch case study highlighted the disruption caused by digital platforms and the need to ensure a level playing field to balance the need between competition and public interest. In the case of UKs low carbon vehicles, the co- funding by government at early stages in technology development has helped to de-risk projects and create an environment in which companies are more confident to invest in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, leading to greater investment, jobs and growth. Furthermore, robust business models are needed to encourage private companies to scale- up the niche solutions that can transform system. Without the involvement and commitment of business, both the new entrants and the incumbents, the transformation of socio-technical systems loses momentum and direction. Strong leadership and government commitment for system transformation are necessary 9. Effective chabada chabado raises formidable policy and management challenges. However, technology alone will not be sufficient to overcome the barriers to transitions: innovation policies must be adapted to specific contexts and aligned/co-ordinated with policies in other areas and with strong political leadership. In the case of Portuguese ocean energy, the government commitment to wave energy was regarded by actors as part of the countrys stable bet in renewable energies, being perceived as potentially providing opportunities similar to the ones that had emerged during the previous (positive) experience with wind energy. In the Dutch case, the lead from the Ministry of Economic Affairs proved critical to consensus around the decision not to immediately regulate new digital platforms but rather to foster an analytical and evidence-based approach to decision making. In the case of the UKs low carbon vehicles, it  gave business greater confidence to invest in the knowledge that the ecosystem for innovation and research benefitted from a strong government commitment. The cases of Japan and Korea also point out the necessity of strong leadership to enable various policy measures and stakeholders to be aligned for the transformation of systems. The Portuguese case study shows that governments decisive involvement increases the credibility of roadmaps. 10. On the other hand, the transparency and neutrality in the process of decision making and implementation also needs to be ensured for the development of mutual trust between all participants as illustrated by the case studies of Austria and Japan.	policy instruments *** policy profiles *** new modes *** policy profiles *** model of innovation *** business models *** support programmes *** human resources *** business research and development *** research organisations *** funded research *** systems innovation *** policy instruments *** policy instruments *** policy instruments *** policy profiles *** public procurement *** policy instruments *** policy mix *** public procurement *** policy instruments *** business models *** existing technologies *** technology development *** business models *** systems innovation *** policy measures	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(2016)9	INNOVATION POLICIES FOR SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION	2016	R	Over the past several years, the OECDs Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) has been studying how the concept of chabada chabado  used in the sense of socio-technical transitions  could help orient innovation policy towards meeting societal challenges, notably sustainability. Chabada chabado as a concept can be characterised as a horizontal approach to innovation policy directed at problems that are systemic in nature such as transitioning towards low carbon energy and transport systems. It involves engaging a range of private and public sector actors and takes a longer-term view in policy. The first phase of the project in 2015 explored the conceptual origins and basis of chabada chabado as a promising horizontal and long-term policy approach to addressing complex social, economic and environmental challenges. It also identified some of the barriers to implementation of chabada chabado: path dependency, disincentives to investments in unproven technologies (e.g. valley of death in financing) as well as misaligned supply and demand-side policies and skills gaps can impede innovations from scaling and diffusing across socio-economic systems, resulting in limited gains to productivity, industrial competitiveness and sustainability. Barriers to innovation and policy misalignments also occur at the intersection of socio-technical systems, which were hitherto considered separately by government policies such as the water- energy- land use nexus. Because of interdependencies of these systems in economic development, innovation-based solutions to the sustainability and growth challenges must increasingly take a system-based approach. The first phase of the OECD chabada chabado project concluded that this implied nothing less than a new mindset and capabilities of policy making bodies. But how to do this in practice? Which policies can be used for chabada chabado? How can the current portfolio of innovation instruments  many of which are focused more on increasing the rate of innovation than its direction  be used to foster system wide transformations? Is there a new role of the state in this context? Phase two of the chabada chabado project, system transformation takes a more practice-oriented perspective and focuses on mainstreaming the systems perspective in the policy mix of innovation policy instruments. While the use of new instruments such as public consultation to help articulate social demands and participation or greater investments in policy intelligence (e.g. technology roadmapping and demonstrators) are part of policy tool kits to foster chabada chabado, many traditional supply and demand side policy instruments remain relevant. The project therefore focuses on making suggestions on how to bring a systems perspective to bear in current policy instruments and practices. One way is to focus on system design (e.g. strengthening information flows), extending planning horizons (e.g. via mechanisms improving the credibility of policy making), managing resistance to change (e.g. through transitional assistance for affected groups), transfer of authority (e.g. by delegating funding decisions), organisational redesign (e.g. via co-ordination mechanisms to address multi-level governance gaps), and creating visions and long-term strategies (e.g. through a mix of top-down and bottom-up inputs). The annex to this paper distils some key insights that are emerging from national case studies conducted in 12 different OECD and Partner countries. These case studies explore how systemic innovation policy instruments such as technology demonstrators, technology roadmapping as well as traditional policies like Research and Development tax credits are being used to promote chabada chabado in industry 4.0 initiatives and 3D printing, which are part of the next production revolution, and green growth initiatives such as renewable ocean energy systems, biofuels and forest-based industries, low carbon vehicles, and autonomous driving vehicles.    INNOVATION POLICIES FOR SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION1  Introduction 1. The demand for innovation among policy makers has never been greater and more purposeful. OECD policy makers are looking towards innovation to address the slowdown in productivity growth; to revitalise manufacturing and industry, to enhance social inclusiveness and to achieve a low-carbon economy. Furthermore, environmental, health, educational, or industry and agricultural ministries all have adopted innovation policies as a means not only to improve delivery on their specific missions but also to address the grand challenges; from climate change, energy security, to ageing populations and the broader sustainable development goals adopted by the United Nations. 2. The goals of innovation for growth and sustainability are not incompatible: Indeed, OECD work on innovation has shown that overcoming the barriers to green innovation  such as the dominance of existing technologies and systems, a regulatory environment that may favour incumbents, or access to capital  could possibly lead to new waves of innovation comparable to those seen with other major technological revolutions (OECD, 2015). Decoupling growth from environmental degradation also requires appropriate market prices, the alignment of many policies (e.g. tax policy, industrial policies) as well as public support to research and innovation (OECD, 2011). There are several problems on the road to achieving sustainability and green growth through innovation however. First, many of the sustainability challenges are inter-related; take for example the transformation of energy and agricultural systems. Second, actor interests and capabilities, markets, network structures, institutions all condition the capacity for public policies to impact on the pace and degree of change, from incremental improvements or the wholesale transformation of a system (Table 1). Third, policies for innovation are not the sole domain of science, technology and industry ministries. This means that mobilising innovation to meet these grand challenges will require co-ordination across ministries and at different levels of government (i.e. regions, city, localities) to facilitate change. But the government cannot do this alone. Private action is also needed; and here policy settings and incentives are the key to encourage firms to increase the efficiency of natural resources and increase the adoption of new technologies and innovations for sustainability.	societal challenges *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** public sector *** environmental problems *** policy approaches *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** policy instruments *** policy mix *** systems innovation *** policy profiles *** policy instruments *** systems innovation *** demand-side policies *** policy instruments *** policy instruments *** green growth *** systems innovation *** tax incentives *** sustainable development *** green technology and innovation *** innovation and growth *** existing technologies *** tax incentives *** green growth *** new technologies	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)1	OECDS CURRENT WORK ON SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES: POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE ITP WORKING GROUP	1994	S	Part 1: Brief review of activities. Early work: Initially, there was no separate programme for work on chabadu chabados, which was included under wider-ranging programmes, i.e. Annual review of industrial policies and developments, and Subsidies and structural adjustment. Turning point: Work on chabadu chabados entered a new phase in 1990, starting with a Canadian proposal to organise a high-level seminar on chabadu chabados. The seminar, held at the OECD in July 1990 under the joint sponsorship of the Industry Committee and the Centre for Co-operation with the European Economies in Transition, addressed the following broad issues: financing, economic environment and technology related aspects of chabadu chabados development. The seminar provided the impetus for launching several studies, with the support of ad hoc meetings of experts, in the three main fields: (i) Technology and competitiveness of chabadu chabados; (ii) chabadu chabados and globalisation and (iii) Government support policies in Member countries and European Economies in Transition, complemented by (iv) Statistical database on chabadu chabados. This drove to the Creation of an Industry Committee Working Party on Small and medium sized enterprises (March 1993) with the following terms of reference. (a) The Working Party is entrusted with examining the nature and scale of chabadu chabados issues. This is intended  to be accomplished through discussions within the Working Party and by reports. The Working Party is also charged with making available to Member governments and other Committees of the Organisation information and advice on those issues and on measures and policies for dealing with them. (b) The chabadu chabados Working Party shall act as a clearing house through which Member countries can exchange information and experience on chabadu chabados programmes and policies, especially in regard to agreed areas of interest and areas identified by the Industry Committee or Council as being of particular relevance to the OECD. (c) The Working Party shall give special consideration to: the  role  and  scope  for  enhancing  the  contributions  of  chabadu chabados  in  economic development  and structural adjustment; the role of chabadu chabados in employment creation, and their effect on the availability of different forms of work (skill  levels); the effects and implications of the globalisation of economic activities for chabadu chabados policies; the securing of a suitable environment for maintaining and increasing the competitiveness of chabadu chabados. (d) The chabadu chabados Working Party shall seek to facilitate international co-operation and exchange of information in the area of chabadu chabados including with non-Member countries, as appropriate and as instructed by the Industry Committee. Part 2: current and future activities. (i) chabadu chabados policies, best practices. This is the core of the Working Partys programme. Four priority areas have been designated: financing; management resources; business environment; market access. (ii) chabadu chabados  information base. (iii) European economies in transition.	small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** international co-operation *** small and medium sized firms *** best practices *** business environment *** small and medium sized firms	firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)10	WORK ON EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCTIVITY AND TECHNOLOGY (ESPECIALLY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY), PROGRESS REPORT TO CSTP	1994	S	The progress report on the work on technology, productivity and job creation will report on the five work programme items defined in the Road Map. The study will address questions of: (i) Methodology (how does the creation and diffusion of technology, accompanied by evolving policy measures and regulatory regimes, impact upon the economy and society?); (ii) Measurement (which quantitative data and indicators are required for an understanding of the creation, development, application and impact of technology?  How can such data, or suitable proxies, be obtained?), (iii) Policy (what policy stance, what policy measures, are required to ensure sustainable vigorous, responsible technological progress and that the realisation of optimum economic and social benefits accrue from it?)The activities to be presented in the progress report to Ministers will address the following issues (figures in parentheses refer to the five Road Map activities): (a) descriptive analytical section: Do firms and sectors which introduce new technology create more  and better jobs than firms which lag behind? To what degree does the increasing dispersion of wages and high rates of unemployment among low-skilled workers reflect technical and organisational change? What is the impact of flexible specialisation, downsizing and re-engineering on jobs? What is the impact on productivity and jobs from technology diffusion - how does the pattern differ over time, between sectors and between countries?  Why? What are the characteristics of the new growth sectors -- are the framework conditions supportive to growth and job creation in these sectors? Do countries hosting firms which take the lead in technical and organisational innovation fare better in terms of jobs? What are the new skills needed? What are the necessary pre-requisites for a rapid deployment of national and global information infrastructures - in terms of private demand, public procurement, standards etc.? How would a more or less rapid deployment (different scenarios) affect answers to the questions posed above? (b) Policy issues section: How to establish an intellectual property regime which stimulates innovation and absorption and which takes into account the growing importance of inter-firm co-operation and of interactive learning? How should the regime differ between sectors? How to reduce barriers to growth in new growth industries, including multi-media and other information intensive and dependent sectors? Is there a need for privatisation, socialisation, regulation, deregulation or reregulation? Are labour markets, financial markets and markets for information responding to the need for growth in these sectors? How should training systems, within firms as well as public, be adapted to the new context? What kind of international co-operation and co-ordination are necessary to promote the development of global information infrastructures? Finally, the study will address questions of perception. Technology is often perceived as being inherently job destructive insofar as it replaces human labour as a factor input. Technology (especially information technology), firm organisation (re-engineering, etc.) and policy and regulatory reform (privatisation, competition) are among the tools in the search for productivity and international competitiveness. As such, the first-order effect is frequently destructive of jobs. These are the most obvious effects and as such receive media attention and, in addition are those most easily picked up by conventional statistical reporting systems. Too frequently, the costs are clear, the benefits less obvious. The costs of regulatory rigidity, of protectionism, of isolationism, of resisting technological advance, need clarification. Governments and their electorates require empirically and analytically-based reassurance about the benefits of promoting innovation.	job creation *** technology diffusion *** policy measures *** policy measures *** firms and sectors *** new technologies *** technology diffusion *** framework conditions *** job creation *** organisational innovations *** public procurement *** intellectual property *** labour market *** international co-operation *** information technology *** regulatory reform *** information technology	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)11/REV1	BEST PRACTICES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICIES; Effectiveness of technology and innovation policies in promoting job-creating growth	1994	S	Technology and innovation policy initiatives in OECD member countries have in recent years placed a much stronger emphasis on the economic impacts of public policy support, particularly with respect to fostering productivity growth and competitiveness (OECD, 1994). The latter in particular is now frequently seen as a key policy goal.   This follows, of course, from an increasing recognition of the role   of technological factors in firm-level competitive performance, and in international trade, and is given increasing urgency by the fact that the past two decades have been characterised by radical changes in major generic technologies. Policy-makers have increasingly focused on these technologies, seeking to improve competitiveness by supporting the innovation and diffusion of products and processes incorporating such technologies. A serious issue, however, is the extent to which such technology and innovation policy objectives if successful either resolve or exacerbate a second key problem in many OECD member countries, namely persistent unemployment. In evaluating technology and innovation policies from an employment point of view, it is necessary to distinguish among a range of analytical issues before we can have even a general view of the policy problems.   These issues include: (i) How can we categorise and classify differences among innovation processes, distinguishing among the various types of change within industrial activities, but also having an adequate understanding of the ways in which the characteristics of innovation differ between industries? (ii) How can we classify the short and long run employment impacts of these types of innovation processes? (iii) How can we classify forms or types of technology and innovation policy (in terms of  differences in objectives, fields of application and instruments), such that we can form a view of their potential impacts both on innovation outcomes, and on employment levels and types? (iv) Where is it necessary to consider the development of new policy instruments or coordination measures to improve the employment impacts of technology policy initiatives? This raises analytical challenges for best-practice policy. A first difficulty concerns the fact that our understanding of the nature of innovation processes has changed significantly in recent years.  Second, in large part as a reflection of this, the contours of technology policy are blurred and changing. The fact that the most consistent links between technology (innovation) policies and employment are also the most indirect is a third source of difficulty. Finally, there is the question of what is meant by best practice itself. We have already referred to the phenomenon of diversity of innovation processes at company and industry level, and this diversity has important implications for how we understand the notion of best practice. Contents of the proposed activity: (A) Conceptual and classificatory framework (B) 5 thematic modules have been identified: co-ordination of research and training  efforts; access to and diffusion of knowledge and technologies; management of large-scale technological programmes; technological entrepreneurship; the creation of new industries and activities with high growth potential.	economic impacts *** diffusion of innovation *** innovation process *** innovation process *** policy instruments *** innovation process *** best practices *** innovation process *** best practices *** technological knowledge *** diffusion of knowledge *** best practices	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)12	PROPOSAL BY THE DELEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES FOR EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON JOBS IN SERVICE ENTERPRISES	1994	S	Services now account for more than two-thirds of the U.S. gross national product and close to three-quarters of U.S. employment. ... Services such as banking, software development, communications, air transportation, and health care are technologically dynamic and crucial to the performance of both U.S. manufacturing and the entire economy. Likewise, OECD recently noted that OECD economies shifted (in the 1980s) towards knowledge-intensive industries away from established capital-intensive ones. Both government and private investments in service infrastructures are believed to have significant potential to improve the competitiveness of producers of goods and services. Such infrastructures considered appropriate  and worthy of government investment have been research, education, communications, data collection, transportation, waste disposal, and health care systems. Increased public investment in such infrastructures may produce high economic returns . Historical examination of public  investments in infrastructure (e.g., roads, canals, mail) shows their underlying importance in creation and support of new enterprises and new types of employment. Recognizing that most economic data are traditionally collected on industries that produce goods (agriculture, manufacturing, mining, etc.), the data on service industries should be collected and aggregated in a compatible way, so that goods and services industries can be compared. Moreover, it would be useful to assess quantitatively the employment by manufacturers of non-manufacturing employees (engineering, design, sales, marketing, information systems, purchasing, and distribution). Such service functions are increasingly provided to manufacturers by external companies, rather than by employees of the manufacturer. It is suggested that the OECD Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (ITP) participate in the OECD response to this challenge by conducting a study of the relationship of technology to job creation and loss in service enterprises	health care *** health care *** public investment in research *** service industries *** job creation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)15	INTERACTIONS IN KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS FOUNDATION, POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND EMPIRICAL METHODS	1994	R	Recent years have seen fundamental changes in the ways we conceptualise innovation processes. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the basis and policy implications of systems approaches to innovation, and then the extent to which policy-relevant empirical descriptions of systems are possible. What kinds of indicators and empirical methods can we use to characterise the profile and interactions of an innovation system? Although this paper is aimed at operational policy tasks there is nevertheless a discussion of underlying conceptual issues. These are related to the nature and characteristics of technological knowledge. The challenge, therefore, is to use existing indicators and methods which give an appreciative understanding of system structures, profiles and dynamics. In general, the past two decades have seen major changes in thinking about the foundations and scope of policies for innovation. These changes have been driven by persistent macroeconomic problems and instabilities since the early 1970s; by scientific and technological revolutions, which are to some extent co-evolving and producing major generic technology change; and by changes in our understanding of the nature and characteristics of innovation processes, and their economic effects. As early as 1980, OECD analysts were arguing that the crisis of the 1970s was both long-run and technology based, and it has since become widely accepted that structural change, changing trade shares, and inter-country growth differences have strong technology components. The argument of this paper is that the systems approach has significant implications for the rationale, objectives and methods of public policies for science, technology and innovation. However it is important to note that there are a number of somewhat different systems approaches available from economic and social studies of innovation. Very broadly these are of three types: Technological system approaches, Industrial cluster approaches, National systems of innovation. economic dynamics and economic performance are primarily shaped by innovation activities, and the focus is on the processes of learning through which technologies are created and used; the argument is that learning is a collective process, shaped by formal institutions (such as universities, corporations, regulatory systems etc) and by social instititions; such knowledge-creating systems are central to economic performance issues.	innovation process *** innovation systems *** technological knowledge *** innovation process *** structural change *** national innovation systems *** innovation activities	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)17	TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT: A REVIEW OF RECENT GOVERNMENT EXERCICES	1994	W2	The OECD Committee for Scientific and Technological Policys Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy organised an ad hoc meeting of experts to discuss recent government technology foresight exercises on 14 September 1994. Presentations were given by representatives from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In addition, the OECD prepared a list of questions on key issues in technology foresight to help structure the discussion. This report of the OECD meeting first sets out a definition of technology foresight and briefly reviews the history and the lessons which emerge from previous international reviews of foresight. The six national presentations made at the OECD meeting are then summarised. These national experiences are analysed to address certain key questions on foresight. For example, why do governments engage in technology foresight? What lessons emerge from the history of foresight? What are the different methodologies used? What are the strengths and weaknesses of Delphi surveys? How reliable are the results? How should industry be involved? Is there scope for international collaboration in technology foresight. And what effect will foresight have in international co-operation or competition? A number of conclusions emerged from the meeting. The first is that there is wide-spread and growing recognition that technology foresight represents a useful tool to aid decision-making in relation to technology policy, whether at the national level or at a more micro-level. Secondly, no individual foresight approach is perfect. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. A third and closely related conclusion is that individual countries may adopt quite different approaches, depending, for example, on the size and nature of their economies. Fourthly, most participants at the meeting were doubtful as to whether a multi-country foresight exercise was desirable, at least at this stage. This is partly because no single, universal foresight approach is possible, and partly because different countries have widely varying objectives and needs in relation to technology foresight. Finally, with the number of countries experimenting with technology foresight now quite large, some mechanism is required to promote the regular interchange of ideas, experiences, problems and lessons. The report concludes with some recommendations as to what the OECD and the Working Group might consider doing next. The first is that OECD should organise another meeting on technology foresight in 12-18 months. Secondly, participants at the ad hoc meeting and OECD officials should convey to CSTP members the consensus view that the meeting was very valuable. Thirdly, OECD could act as a central clearing house for information on technology foresight. Fourthly, OECD might also assume a marriage broker role, where a country seeks to collaborate with others. Finally, OECD might create an electronic bulletin board on technology foresight, overseeing its operation and publicising its existence.	foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** international collaboration *** international co-operation *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)2	STATISTICS AND INDICATORS FOR INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY	1994	R	OECD has developed S&T statistics and indicators since the early 1960s. Frequently, the OECD has brought the Member countries together to agree international methodology and definitions and then created databases at the OECD from a data reporting system also agreed by the countries. The best known are the series based on the Frascati Manual for RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT statistics (financial and human resources employed), but the battery of indicators also includes data on patents, the Technology Balance of Payments, High-technology industries and products, innovation indicators, and so on. Innovation statistics measure aspects of the industrial innovation process and the resources devoted to innovation activities. They also provide qualitative and quantitative information on the factors enhancing or hampering innovation, on the impact of innovation, on the performance of the enterprise and on the diffusion of innovation. The methodology for national surveys into the measurement of industrial innovation, notably those of the Community Innovation Surveys conducted under the aegis of the EU institutions is contained in the Oslo Manual which was developed in the OECD and issued early in 1992. Among the methodological issues currently being considered by the NESTI group are: treatment of chabadu chabados, concentration by sector, globalisation issues and indicators (geographical origin of firms, firm structures), protection of innovation, high-technology sectors. Patent statistics provide simple, rapidly available, indicators of innovation outputs. They correspond directly to international technology policy concerns about intellectual property rights. However, innovation surveys tend to suggest that are not a primary innovation concern for enterprises. Patent data cover applications and grants classified by field of technology. The OECDs international patents database covers total applications data for its Member countries for four categories: i) patents taken out by residents of a country in that country; ii) patents taken out in a country by non-residents of that country; iii) total patents registered in the country or naming it; iv) patents taken out outside a country by its residents. The database of patents applied for in the U.S. is broken down by the country of residence of applicants, by industrial product field and by field of technology. At the moment, there are no international guidelines for the use of patent statistics as S&T indicators. Bibliometrics involves the analysis of statistics of the scientific literature. Indicators are derived from the number and authors of scientific publications, articles and the citations therein (and in patents). They measure the output of research teams, institutions and countries, identify national and international networks and new (multi-disciplinary) fields of science and technology. The OECD has never been a primary actor in this field and is unlikely to do so in the future, depending on private-sector databases when needed. However, NESTI has developed a guide to the interpretation of bibliometric data as S&T indicators	human resources *** innovation process *** innovation activities *** industrial innovation *** diffusion of innovation *** industrial innovation *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** scientific publications	policy_area_human_resources *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)3/REV1	TECHNOLOGY FLOWS IN NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF INNOVATION	1994	R	1. Innovative firms increasingly use external sources of technological knowledge in their innovation process. This report investigates why and how they do so, which differences exist among countries and what the implications of this trend are for government chabadi chabado. 2. The major driving force behind the growing reliance on external sources is the increasing velocity and complexity of technical progress itself. Since innovation is the key to a strong competitive position, firms cannot afford to lag behind in this technology race. This makes it all the more important to be connected to the technological development outside the enterprise. 3. The innovative capacities of an enterprise are not only determined by the investment in internal Research and Development. Access to the right external sources of knowledge is essential. As a consequence, the effectiveness and efficiency of a national system of innovation depends crucially on its ability to distribute technological information. The technological capacity of a country is determined by its capacity to produce technological knowledge and its capacity to transfer technological information to potential users. In other words, the two main criteria by which national systems of innovation should be rated are: production capacity and distribution capacity. This report analyses inter-firm relations and relations between firms and public institutions as an important element of the distribution capacity of national systems of innovation. 4. There is a wide variety of organisations that firms may use as external sources of knowledge. The report distinguishes between inter-firm technology exchange and technology transfer between public research institutions and firms. And it provides a typology of different types of relations: market transactions, co-operative agreements, informal networks and integration. 5. The analysis of types of relations for technology transfer does not take into account the specific characteristics of individual countries. In order to assess and compare the distribution capacities of national systems, a typology is needed that takes the characteristics of the entire system into account. The typology developed in this report to compare the distribution capacities of different national systems distinguishes three capacities on which national systems can be compared in terms of strengths and weaknesses: --  capacities to produce contractual tools; --  capacities to build and maintain social networks; -- capacities to create a supportive environment in terms of infrastructure and rules and regulations. 6. This typology is tested on two countries: Japan and Germany. Although the typology proves to be helpful in providing a framework for international comparisons, more and better data are needed to draw any firm conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries. 7. When looking at the policy implications of this analysis it is important to make a distinction between inter-firm technology flows and flows between public institutions and firms. In most countries the impact of government policy on the inter-firm exchange of information, will be fairly indirect. First and foremost governments should provide an environment that is supportive to the inter-firm information exchange. This applies to such elements as the quality of the communications infrastructure as well as to the rules and regulations related to inter-firm information exchange.   8. An example of a more direct government involvement is to define criteria for technology subsidies so as to encourage firms to participate in co-operative projects. Another example where governments can play an role as an active intermediate in inter-firm transfer of technology, is a policy to stimulate firms to make a more active use of information in patent databases. 9. The role of public institutions in the national system of innovation is one of the central themes  in recent discussions on chabadi chabado in many member countries. This in itself is not new. The last decade has seen a considerable amount of policy initiatives to improve the diffusion of information from public institutions to firms. This typically concerns a one-way transfer of knowledge from a public research institution, that produces knowledge, to a firm, that applies it in the economic process. Although this one-way diffusion model is still important, especially when technology transfer to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is concerned, more attention is being paid to the possible role of public institutions as partners in technological development of technology-driven companies. 10. There are three reasons for this trend to occur. First of all the character of technological development itself has changed in ways that renders a go it alone innovation strategy increasingly difficult. The increasing velocity and complexity of technological development, urges both firms and public institutions to rely more and more on network types of co-operation in their innovative activities. 11. The second reason is that the way we perceive the innovation process has changed. It is now widely acknowledged that the linear model of innovation (which supposes that the innovation process is   a well-defined time sequence that originates in research activities, involves a product development phase and then leads to production and commercialisation) is too simple a representation of the innovation process. In fact, feedbacks between phases in the innovation processes and incremental improvements along the way are far more important than the linear model leads us to believe. This urges one to look for solutions in terms of two-way exchange, partnerships and networks rather than one-way transfer. 12. The third reason to see public institutions as partners in technological development is a variety of factors that lie outside the realm of technological development itself. One important factor is the globalisation of economic activities. Since these activities tend to be more footloose, there is a certain competition among countries in attracting business activities. In the case of technological activities, one of the ways to achieve this is to invest in an infrastructure of public institutions, that can be interesting partners for innovative firms. 13. In order to strengthen the distribution capacity of national system of innovation through the public research institutions, governments may work along four lines: --  invest in an excellent infrastructure of public research institutions; -- ensure build-in incentives for these institutions to co-operate with other institutions and private enterprises; --  promote mobility of researchers among organisations; --  provide incentives for firms to co-operate with public institutions.	technological knowledge *** innovation process *** innovative firms *** technology development *** international research *** innovation capacity *** information technology *** national innovation systems *** technological knowledge *** information technology *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** technology transfer *** technology transfer *** research organisations *** technology transfer *** research organisations *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** knowledge transfer *** public research *** research organisations *** research organisations *** technology development *** technology transfer *** technology development *** research organisations *** technology development *** innovation activities *** innovation process *** research activities *** model of innovation *** innovation process *** product development *** innovation process *** research organisations *** technology development *** research organisations *** innovative firms *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** national innovation systems	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)4	ACCESSING AND EXPANDING THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE BASE	1994	R	This report proposes a conceptual framework for guiding comparative analyses of Member countries innovation systems. Such a framework can be characterized by: its theoretical foundations; its ability to be used as a tool for conducting empirical studies which would add to the current knowledge of the functioning of national innovation systems; and the policy relevance of the issues that, thereby, could possibly be considered or re-examined. 2. The theoretical options taken in the report are such as to : -- ensure a convergence between the analysis of systems of innovation and the more general economic analysis of the implications of the emergence of a knowledge-based economy; -- acknowledge the complementarities between knowledge distribution and innovation, rather than accepting a dichotomy between technology diffusion and generation; and -- analyse national systems of innovation as they are enmeshed in larger, more complex transnational relationships. 3. The key organizing concept is the distribution power of an innovation system, which means its capability to ensure timely access by innovators to the relevant stocks of knowledge. The report identifies the characteristics of a distribution-oriented system, as well as the specific capabilities in the adjacent domains of education and training, financing, and industrial organization (Japan is taken as an example). Furthermore, the report demonstrates that a distribution-oriented system is not a transitory state, designed to meet the innovation requirements of a technological borrower committed to a strategy of catching-up. It is an organizational mode of innovation that is able to support the various steps of the process of technological advance. 4. The report advocates that policy-makers of Member countries need to have a better picture of their countrys (and other nations) performance with regard to the distribution of knowledge; and, symmetrically, of the magnitude of the loss of innovation potential due to the limitations of their knowledge-distribution and knowledge-pooling capabilities. 5. It is necessary to reconsider in this perspective available indicators on scientific and technological activities. The report contains proposals for interpreting existing indicators as well as for developing new ones, designed specifically to measure the distribution power of an innovation system. 6. The report points to a number of policy issues which could be reconsidered from the perspective of knowledge distribution. First, it stresses the need for domestic policies to adjust their objectives and instruments to the new paradigm for technological innovation, based upon more systematic and intensive exploitation of available knowledge bases and strategies of recombination and integration for the generation of novelty. This would involve in particular greater integration between Science and Technology and information technology policies. Secondly, it identifies many areas for potential international economic liberalization and cooperation that would serve to strengthen the respective national innovation systems. Among the subjects that deserve further examination in this regard are intellectual property rights harmonization, international standards institutions, co-operation on electronic infrastructures and on megascience facilities, and coordination of arrangements for overseas training of scientists and engineers.	innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems *** knowledge-based economy *** innovation systems *** innovation systems *** knowledge base *** information technology *** national innovation systems *** intellectual property *** technological knowledge *** knowledge base	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)5	PROPOSAL FOR AN AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON GOVERNMENT FORESIGHT EXERCISES	1994	S	Several countries have expressed interest in the establishment of a methodology for conducting technology foresight exercises, studies of the future perspective of science and technology development. When governments carry out long-term Research and Development programmes, they require strategic analysis and evaluation of the trends of technology development and future market demands. Foresight exercises are therefore of use to chabadi chabado makers who need to determine what should be done under government Research and Development programmes. Foresight exercises can clarify several decisive factors for the promotion of Research and Development in the field of basic and applied technology. There are some parameters, such as priority of research areas and items, forecast realisation time of research results, comparison of the level of current Research and Development efforts with those of foreign countries, necessity for international co-operation, technical, financing and institutional constraints on realisation. Foresight exercises can help gauge the likely effect of these parameters on the outcome of the technology forecast. If the analysis and the evaluation are conducted on the same methodological basis among the OECD Member countries, one can benefit from sharing common science and technology indicators and the basic information on future perspectives for science and technology. It permits international comparison and facilitates discussion of international co-operation. Some countries have already conducted foresight exercises. Japan has developed the Delphi method and has used it to carry out technical surveys every five years since 1971. In 1992, the German government launched a very similar survey, with the close co-operation of the Japanese authorities. The two countries co-organised the Japan-Germany Delphi Seminar at the end of April 1994.  In early 1994, the French government launched the first stage of a Delphi technology foresight exercise. There are also foresight exercises being carried out in the Netherlands and the U.K. is actively considering taking up and implementing its own exercise. At the 61st session of the CSTP, held on 18-19 October 1993, the Japanese government presented their experience in using the Delphi method for technology foresight exercises and suggested it may be useful to hold a meeting on this subject at the OECD. OECD countries would then have an opportunity to exchange information on particular foresight exercises and discuss more generally the related issues of goals, methodology and international comparability.	technology development *** foresight exercises *** technology development *** development programmes *** foresight exercises *** development programmes *** foresight exercises *** international co-operation *** research results *** foresight exercises *** international co-operation *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(94)9	DRAFT ISSUES PAPER ON INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CO-OPERATION	1994	R	1. At the last meeting of the OECDs Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP) at Ministerial level, in March 1992, Ministers agreed that, as a consequence of increased internationalisation, there was a need for stronger and increased scientific and technological co-operation. They stressed, therefore, that Member countries should strive to implement further the Recommendation concerning a General Framework of Principles for International Co-operation in Science and Technology, which was adopted by the OECD Council in 1988, following the 1987 meeting of the CSTP at Ministerial level [C(88)60(Final)]. That Recommendation urged Member countries to strive to promote international co-operation in science and technology, in particular, through: a) promoting international co-operation in research programmes for the transfer of scientific and technological knowledge to enterprises; b) encouraging the circulation, exchange and trade of technologies as well as co-operation between enterprises, including small and medium- sized enterprises, in particular through improved access to worldwide markets and improved harmonization of standards and regulations; and c) promoting improved universal protection of intellectual and industrial property rights. 2. The 1992 CSTP Ministerial meeting also invited the CSTP to develop and establish effective arrangements for the exchange of information and discussion of international co-operation in large science projects and programmes. The Megascience Forum has provided Member countries with opportunities to discuss a number of aspects of international co-operation. Participation in major international research facilities (e.g. CERN) and in large-scale geographically distributed research programs (e.g. human genome research) requires multilateral agreements between participants on the sharing of costs, the allocation of resources and the choice of priorities. It also allows participants to benefit from economies of scale. 3. The foundations for this paper are found in the previous work of the CSTP, the outcomes of the 1987 and 1992 meetings of the CSTP at Ministerial level referred to above, and the more recent work of its sub-groups, such as the Megascience Forum and the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy. The paper seeks to develop further the policies underpinning international co-operation in science and technology.	international co-operation *** research programmes *** international co-operation *** intellectual property *** technological knowledge *** international co-operation *** international co-operation *** international research *** international co-operation *** international technology co-operation	internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)11	TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE SERVICE SECTOR, report	1995	W2	Recommendations for Next Steps Jack Triplett, Bureau of Economic Analysis, asked whether a new paradigm was needed for the economy. Measurement difficulties abounded in both manufacturing and services.  So  a  distinction between economies would not be useful, nor a dynamic new plan to restore employment in goods. At the core was the issue of productivity.  This impacted on other issues, such as changing the  tax on long run capital growth. The determinants of productivity were not understood, and  its  measurement involved looking at inputs and outputs. At present many categories were just catch-alls thrown together. Triplett was chairing a group re-working classifications and the system itself, since the present framework did not even point in the right direction. Lingering on conceptual difficulties might get in the way, and it was important first to obtain an adequate data base. Steven Landefeld, Bureau of Economic Analysis, described how his Bureau's new strategic plan deals with services, and addresses changes in the economy.  They would work on the international area of traded services for the BoP, especially on financial services, and on filling gaps in the National Accounts. Major areas of work would include: Conceptual definition of output: dealing with rapid innovation and price changes. A start would  be made on financial services, real estate, and high tech goods. Measures: filling gaps in coverage, the largest of which were for services.  The  quinquennial benchmark surveys now cover some services more fully, such as transport. Investment:  definitions would be broadened. International trade:  30 new services had been added in the past decade, with the help of the Coalition   of Service Industries. This also covered trade with affiliates abroad, and by foreign affiliates in the US. The 1992 supplemental Balance of Payments data had dealt with trade data on an ownership basis by establishment.  Goods and services were now put together in the monthly BoP estimates. Financial Services: an attempt would be made to capture data from foreign owned firms that did not have to report before. In volatile areas it was hoped to do annual surveys. Conceptual work was also proceeding in other areas, to deal with new products, new activities, new actors, changing delivery routes and prices. Charles Hulten, University of Maryland, said the general problem economists perceived was the rapid rate of technological progress and the flight of employment to the service sector, and the two were linked. Nationally there was a rise in inputs, and a rise in manufacturing output but from a  shrinking  labour force. What should be done both conceptually and in practice? How can different views be actualised? There are deep seated problems. A fundamental barrier is that no one has a firm grasp of the creature for which all search. Standard economics does not help. Academic economists should be urged to think more carefully on the nature of economic activity. A better job could be done on employment data as a proxy for output, and National Accounts could add in depreciation on capital, with an implied positive rate of return. The imputed value of capital should be included where this is not done. Making comparisons between data bases internationally is a valuable research tool, and in future this must include services in parallel with goods.	service industries *** new actors *** new products *** services sector *** employment growth *** economic growth *** services sector	policy_area_services *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)14	Research and Development TAX TREATMENT IN OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES PROJECT PROPOSAL BY THE CANADIAN DELEGATION	1995	S	The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been interested in developing a uniform methodology to document, compare and analyse the relative attractiveness of tax incentives offered for corporate research and development (Research and Development) activities by the Member countries. The proposed study would analyse and compare the Research and Development tax treatment in 25 OECD Member countries. The B-index model makes it possible to measure the relative attractiveness of Research and Development systems among countries. The B-index yields the present value of before-tax income necessary to cover the cost of an initial Research and Development investment and to pay the applicable income taxes so that an Research and Development project becomes profitable for the firm that undertakes it. The work on the project would include the following steps: (i) Gather from the most up-to-date, professional sources available in Canada and OECD the  detailed tax information pertaining to the Research and Development tax treatment in each OECD Member country.  The following information on corporate income tax systems (national, federal, and applicable provinces and states) will be required: statutory corporate income rates, deductibility of Research and Development expenses of current and capital nature, tax credits, tax depreciation, and other applicable tax provisions. (ii) Revise mathematical formulas for B-indexes where necessary, and develop formulas for the countries to be analysed. B-indexes will be calculated based on national corporate income tax systems, including tax rates for large and small companies, selected provinces, states or other regions. When local or regional comparisons are required, it is proposed that up to three local or regional jurisdictions are selected for analysis. These local jurisdictions would represent a range of typical cases within member countries. (iii) Calculate B-indexes and on this basis analyse the Research and Development tax systems of OECD Member countries. (iv) Involve OECD Member countries to verify the estimates of B-indexes pertaining to their respective countries and clarify any missing data in the analysis. The country response  should  not take more than one month to complete. (v) Prepare a report from the research. This will also include a comprehensive description of the corporate income tax system applicable to Research and Development of the countries examined, and a discussion of the B-index methodology. (vi) Present the findings to the OECD Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy.	tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** research and development expenditures *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** tax systems	policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)2/ANN1/REV3	DRAFT RECOMMENDATION OF THE COUNCIL PRINCIPLES FOR FACILITATING INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CO-OPERATION INVOLVING ENTERPRISES	1995	R	I. Governments should facilitate international bilateral and multilateral co-operation in technology development between enterprises, to help maximise the effectiveness of private sector and related public sector tangible and intangible investments. II. Governments should maintain an effective intellectual property rights protection and enforcement regime. III. Governments and their standards organisations should, wherever practicable, apply international standards to facilitate compatibility and market openness while not restraining innovation. IV. Governments, in furthering the public good, can fulfil a useful role in structuring and implementing co-operation between each other, that involves enterprises and other institutions as partners. V. The objective of international technology co-operation should be to bring about complementary and collaborative private sector investments in the development and diffusion of technologies that will: provide the basis for economic growth in the partner countries; accelerate change to everyone's benefit; and, build international business networks. VI. Enterprises should take an active role, in co-operation with universities and government research institutions, in establishing goals, planning, structuring and managing co-operation projects, so as, among other things, to ensure that enterprises can translate science and technology into successful innovations. VII. Projects should be governed by agreements between partners; formal agreements between governments should be concluded only when essential to bring about the desired collaboration. VIII. Arrangements for co-operation between the various partners should address, in terms of technical topics, intellectual property rights, agreements and consortium structure, so as to enable the partners to alter the programme, project design, participation, or membership, to meet changing needs and circumstances. IX. Governments should encourage the widest feasible participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in co-operative projects, in recognition of their niche strengths, and potential to add value to projects and bring about a wider application of the resulting technologies. X. The partners in the co-operation should come to an understanding on the protection of intellectual property rights, as well as fair and equitable contributions to projects, dissemination of information and access to and the use of the results of the co-operation.	public sector *** technology development *** private sector *** intellectual property *** technology diffusion *** development and diffusion *** private sector *** international technology co-operation *** economic growth *** research organisations *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** international technology co-operation	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)2/FINAL	INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CO-OPERATION	1995	R	37. Today, OECD Member countries are seeking mutual benefits from international technology co- operation, although some areas of research may be more suited to international co-operation than others. The 1988 OECD Recommendation concerning a General Framework of Principles for International Co- operation in Science and Technology encourages Member countries to promote mutually beneficial scientific and technological exchanges and to remove barriers to these activities. Member countries are also recognising that science and technology co-operation agreements need to ensure an equitable sharing of outcomes (particularly, but not only, intellectual property rights), taking into account the relative contributions of the various parties, including prior knowledge and in-kind contributions. Netotiation for the equitable allocation of intellectual property rights needs to take account of a range of issues including differences in market size and access and of the advantages (and, sometimes, disadvantages) of first movers in many technologies. In principle, Member countries should accord foreign researchers and firms involved in technology co-operation projects the rights and benefits that it provides to its own nationals. 38. For firms involved in international co-operation, science and technology agreements are becoming more important. There is an increasing number of firm-to-firm co-operation agreement, but firms are sometimes reluctant to become involved in international technology co-operation because of concerns about the possible loss of competitive advantages. It may be necessary to develop additional forms of co-operation adapted to the special needs of chabadu chabados. 39. International agreement on the principles to be applied to technology co-operation can minimise costs and risks to governments, researchers and firms. OECD has a long-standing role in the development of such principles. Other important technology-related activities in which the OECD has played a leading role are the establishment of guidelines for the security of information systems and the regulation of chemicals and the creation of safety guidelines and principles for biotechnology	international co-operation *** technology co-operation *** technology co-operation *** intellectual property *** technology co-operation *** intellectual property *** technology co-operation *** international co-operation *** international technology co-operation *** small and medium sized firms *** technology co-operation *** international technology co-operation	policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)4	AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON FISCAL MEASURES TO PROMOTE Research and Development AND INNOVATION - DRAFT REPORT	1995	W2	Main Points. (1) The Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy of the OECD Committee for  Scientific and Technological Policy organises, back-to-back with its regular sessions, a series  of  workshops on specific aspects of technology policy.  In this context, an ad hoc meeting of experts was  held in January 1995 on Fiscal measures to promote Research and Development and innovation. (2) In many Member countries, as well as in most Dynamic Asian Economies, tax measures to support Research and Development represent an important component (notably in terms of budget expenditures) of public policy to support innovation. But there have been recurrent debates on the effectiveness of such  support  measures, especially in the context of overall tax reforms, or in periods of acute budget stringency. (3) The purpose of the meeting was to provide a forum for an exchange of information and views on recent trends in national policies regarding the tax treatment of Research and Development expenses, and on the effectiveness of related tax support schemes. The meeting addressed the following main questions: What arguments have justified the adoption of tax support schemes? What are the main similarities and differences between national support schemes? How are support schemes monitored and evaluated?  Which are the main  lessons of recent evaluations? (4) Most of the experts were government delegates involved in the management or evaluation of support schemes, but scholars and representatives of the private sector  also took part in the meeting. The outcome of the discussions is presented in Part 1 (Rapporteurs report). Part 2 provides an overview of the trends and issues which were examined. Part 3 describes the characteristics and assesses the effectiveness of selected national support schemes, which have been in existence for some time (Australia, France, Japan, United States), or have been recently introduced (Netherlands).  Part 4  contains  a background report, prepared with the support of the French Delegation, which synthethises available information for comparing the various national tax support schemes	supporting research and development *** support innovation *** tax systems *** support schemes *** support schemes *** support schemes *** support schemes *** private sector *** support schemes *** support schemes *** support schemes	objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes

The Working Group was requested to consider (i) a draft future mandate and(ii) specific suggestions for its future work programme at  the next Working Group meeting on 6-8 June 1995 and to report back to the 65th CSTP meeting, in September 1995.The Secretariat informed the Committee about the Workshop on technology, productivity and employment in service industry. The Labour Management Programme (LMP) meeting on international technology co-operation will take place on 1 June at the OECD. The Secretariat consulted national delegates on possible topics of TIP Workshop to be held in conjunction with the 6th meeting of the Working Group in November. The subject venture capital market was proposed.It is envisaged to organise a high level conference on Technology Policy for Job-creating Growth at the end of 1995.	international technology co-operation *** venture capital	internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)6	WORKSHOP ON TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE SERVICE SECTOR	1995	W2	The purpose of this Workshop is to summarise current knowledge about the relationship of modern technology to service jobs, and to identify key questions to which policy-makers and industry seek answers. This workshop will discuss some of the major conceptual and methodological issues that have contributed to the inadequacy of service sector data. The participants will explore ways in which the collection of internationally comparable statistics on the service sector can be improved. Background: Services such as banking, software development, communications, air transportation, and health care are technologically dynamic and crucial to the performance of both U.S. manufacturing and the entire economy. In a similar vein, OECD has noted that the economies of its member countries shifted in the 1980s towards knowledge-intensive industries and away from established capital-intensive industries. Both government and private investments in service infra structures are believed to have significant potential to improve the competitiveness of producers of goods and services. Such infrastructures considered appropriate and worthy of government investment have been research, education, communications, data collection, transportation, waste disposal, and health care systems. Increased public investment in such infrastructures may produce high economic returns. Historical examination of public investments in infrastructure (e.g., roads, canals, mail) shows their underlying importance in creation and support of new enterprises and new types of employment. Such fundamentals were considered at the March 1994 Ministerial meeting of the G-7 on Jobs. One outcome of this G-7 discussion was a call for OECD to examine the relationship between productivity, job creation and technology, especially information technology, and to expand its analysis of data on job creation and job loss. As a result, the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) of OECDs Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP) has joined with the United States Department of Commerce to conduct a Workshop on the impact of technology on jobs in service enterprises. Framework for discussion. The Workshop on technology and service employment will address the current state of knowledge of the facts and issues involved, as well as steps necessary to provide decision makers with answers to their most pressing questions in this arena. Among the most pressing problems that must be addressed are establishing internationally comparable classifications of service outputs, and dealing with conceptual problems of quality and convenience -- factors that are key to deriving relevant productivity measures. A conceptual frame of reference is being developed by OECD for understanding the links between technology, innovation and employment. This project specifically arises from the aforementioned G-7 request, and has been initiated to study the effectiveness of technology and innovation policies in promoting job-creating growth. It is recognised that the most consistent links between technology (innovation) policies and employment are also the most indirect. Therefore, establishing causal relationships is not currently possible. However, useful insights will undoubtedly result from the three project activities: a conceptual study, an empirical analysis of survey results, and a synthesis of both the conceptual and empirical results. At the January 1995 meeting of the OECD Working Group which is co-sponsoring this Workshop, three papers were distributed, as seeds for more empirical thought and discussion. Ian Miles provided a draft paper on the topic of Services Innovation: Statistical and Conceptual Issues. He included data showing that, contrary to common belief, services do perform Research and Development and Research and Development is probably increasing in size and importance. For example, software producer Microsoft Corporation will spend some $900 million on Research and Development in fiscal year 1995. In the United Kingdom, British Telecommunications Ltd. and Reuters were in the top 20 spenders on Research and Development. Data from the Netherlands indicate that the Research and Development intensity of business services approximately equals that of manufacturing industries. While traditional definitions of manufacturing, services, output, and Research and Development, plague efforts at quantitative analysis, it is clear that technologically based innovation is increasing substantially  in service enterprises. A paper by Templ and Lhuillery presents the results of a study carried out at the request of the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research with a view to gaining an accurate understanding   of the conditions under which innovation and Research and Development activities were performed in the services sector. They found that Research and Development in the services sector involved more researchers than the pharmaceutical, automobile or computer sectors. and that over 50 per cent of firms in the services sector with fewer than 100 employees pursue informal Research and Development activities, and there are more firms with over 500 employees in the services sector which organise their research activities informally than there are in other sectors. A paper by Gault and Pattinson argued that the increasing importance of service industries  in the industrialised economies argues for a comparable (to manufacturing) understanding through measurement of innovation in the service sector. They propose building upon OECD's Oslo Manual which has been useful for surveys of innovation in goods-producing firms. In particular, they hope to base an OECD survey of service firms on studies by the Voorburg Group; each firm would be asked to identify its innovative activities, sources of ideas for innovation, barriers to innovation, and costs of innovation. Thus, it is expected that a small group of leaders (data users, data providers and industry representatives) will come together on May 3-5 to: identify data limitations in the service sector, such as definitions of outputs, productivity measures, and other key concepts, select indicators that would be most useful for examining the role of technology in the service sector, and that would be most readily provided by industry, and consider how to improve classification systems to satisfy these new data requirements and provide international comparability. Special emphasis will be placed on employment data, but not simply the quantity of jobs affected. Traditional measures such as percentage of the workforce unemployed, and percentage of the workforce with science or engineering degrees are useful. But indicators of the quality and dynamics of service jobs affected are also needed : for example, income distribution, demand for higher skills, non- degree training, and scientific-engineering training. Discussion is also needed of the employment by manufacturers of non-manufacturing employees (engineering, design, sales, marketing, information systems, purchasing, and distribution). Services driven by information technologies should, as suggested by the G-7, be given special attention. For example, computer programming, data processing, telecommunications, architectural and engineering services, accounting, banking and financial services, printing and publishing should be appraised.	services sector *** services sector *** health care *** health care *** public investment in research *** public investment in research *** job creation *** information technology *** innovation in services *** research and development intensity *** service industries *** higher education *** research and development activities *** education and research *** services sector *** services sector *** research and development activities *** services sector *** service industries *** services sector *** innovation activities *** services sector *** information technology *** employment growth *** economic growth *** services sector	policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)7	INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CO-OPERATION: LESSONS AND PRINCIPLES FROM THE IMS PROJECT	1995	R	50. Nine principles to guide technology co-operation have been advanced in the context of the OECD Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy. To some extent, their wording and substance draw on the IMS experience to date, as well as from other instances of international co- operation. In current form, the Principles offer a valuable endorsement of international co-operation which can only help the process forward, and would especially do so if approved by the OECD ministers. The major criticism one can make is that they tend to ignore a number of areas on which a positive or more complete statement would be valuable. Four issues of this nature stand out, which are discussed below.  In each case, language is proposed for consideration as addenda to the Principles. 5.1 The Objectives of Co-operation 51. Principles I and II posit the objectives and benefits of technology collaboration exclusively in economic terms. Member countries are urged to facilitate technical collaboration to help maximise the effectiveness of private sector investments. [Principle I] The explicit goal is to bring about private  sector investments in the development and diffusion of technologies that will provide the basis for economic growth...accelerate change...build international business networks...and broaden industrial co- operation. [Principle II] 52. The economic objectives posited in the principles legitimately rank among any society's paramount goals. Moreover, there is a well-recognised case for public sector involvement in their pursuit, especially when market barriers limit the ability of the private sector to achieve them. This may be particularly the case with respect to international co-operation, which often goes unrealised due to barriers of information, culture, institutions, financing and administration. At the same time, however, the economic objectives of industry are only a subset of the goals that society as a whole strives for. And for governmental and mulitlateral agencies to limit their own activities to support for an industrially determined agenda would represent a serious case of myopia. The limited scope of Principles I and II skirt the boundaries of this problem. 53. An immense range of societal objectives co-exist with economic growth as goals both attainable in large part through technology and of vital importance to industry. Environmental quality, health, communications and other infrastructure elements come immediately to mind. Objectives such as these should be incorporated by the Principles among the goals toward which international co-operation can be turned. 54. IMS, in fact, offers a particularly good example of the harmony between societal -- notably environmental -- and industrial purposes. One of the long-term goals of environmental policy is to reduce inputs of natural materials and energy into industrial processes. Reliance on intelligent processes and information systems clearly moves toward this goal. In the more immediate term, it is well-recognised that an improved ability to control and systematise diverse manufacturing operations is a main pathway to pollution and waste reduction. Self-monitoring and correcting manufacturing systems, key to the development of this environmental capability, typically offer similar increments of efficiency and quality improvement. Indeed, complementarities such as these have not been ignored in the IMS research agenda. The Clean Manufacturing test case overtly responds to industry's environmental needs, and other technical foci will also prove broadly applicable in this respect over the long term. It is also worth noting that MITI's original IMS proposal cited the environmental benefits as one of its main motivations.   55. The following language is offered as a means to incorporate societal objectives more effectively into the process of international technology co-operation: II. The objective of international technology co-operation be to bring about complementary and collaborative private sector investments in the development and diffusion of technologies that will: provide the basis for economic growth in the partner countries; accelerate change to everyone's benefit; build international business networks; broaden industrial co-operation; and, promote the achievement of societal goals articulated in public policy. [Additions in emphasis] 5.2 Governmental Roles 56. The governmental role in international technology co-operation envisioned by the Principles is mainly that of a background player, engaged in establishing underlying intellectual property rights and standards (Principles VII and IX). Beyond this, member countries are  encouraged to facilitate international collaboration (Principle I) and the widest feasible participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (Principle VI). A more proactive role for government is contemplated in Principle IV, concerning the agreements made to govern international co-operation, but the language of the provision makes it clear that government structuring of such agreements is to be avoided except when essential to bring about the desired collaboration. 57. The IMS experience shows government cast as a much more activist player, and in more diverse roles, than the Principles suggest. Although IMS research and the beginnings of international collaboration arose out of the private technical communities in the U.S. and Japan, financing for this work was provided in part through governmental organs (e.g., NSF), and quasi-public organisations (JSPS and NRC) established a needed venue within which collaboration could first be realised. Here, one sees government's traditional role in supporting science research and the structures of technical co-operation relevant to industry. 58. The second stage of IMS, in which MITI's proposal for a multilateral programme was unveiled, exemplifies the government role as both initiator and funder of large-scale technical projects. Certainly,  no entity other than government could have credibly proposed an undertaking of such scope, duration and magnitude. Nor one in which the benefits would be so widely shared across institutions and countries.  The governmental budgetary commitments contemplated for IMS, particularly in Europe and Japan, attest to the continuing validity of this role and the frequent need for sustaining public financing in a project where generic research and long time frames are hallmarks. 59. The third stage of IMS, in which the U.S. government took such a large role in reformulating the project, shows a classic situation of government intervention to establish rules of the game that safeguard important social interests. The resulting structure of the project, which emphasises openness, pluralism and procedural clarity, was unlikely to have arisen absent such intervention or without the formal agreement between governments on which it was based. 60. The current phase of IMS shows yet another set of governmental functions -- catalyst, networker, forum, referee, facilitator and publicist for activities carried out in the private sector. Without the dedication of many public servants to this process, it is highly doubtful that IMS would ever have matured into a multilateral co-operative enterprise. 61. These experiences with public-private co-operation in the case of IMS suggest the following possible modifications to Principle IV:   IV. Projects be governed by agreements between partners as well as formal agreements between governments or sponsoring multilateral organisations. The partnership role of public bodies with the private sector in initiating, financing, structuring and facilitating international co-operative research is recognised. [Additions in emphasis] 5.3 Roles for Multilateral International Organisations 62. The Principles do not refer at all to the possibility that multilateral international organisations could play a useful affirmative role in facilitating international technology co-operation. This omission deserves reconsideration. 63. The IMS experience to date has unfolded largely in the context of individual governments' actions initiating, regulating and facilitating international co-operation. Given the different objectives and operating styles of these governments, a number of significant conflicts have arisen -- notably in the areas of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, funding and procedure. It has also been apparent that the administrative arrangements governments have -- or do not have -- in place to facilitate international co-operation are by no means standardised. At the time of the MITI IMS proposal, for example, it was not clear which agency in the U.S. government would take the lead in overseeing the U.S.-Japan Co-operative Agreement for Science and Technology, and the capability to manage IMS and future collaborative ventures has only emerged ad hoc. Indeed, perhaps the principal absorption of the IMS project to date has been to put together management structures that amount to a mini-international organisation. 64. Some observers have argued forcefully that it is time to consider the creation of a world scientific organisation to promote scientific exchange in a systematic fashion and overcome the administrative difficulties that now plague it.9 It may also be time to consider an overt role for international organisations in promoting international technology co-operation.  In some limited contexts - - notably the environmental arena -- this is occurring already. For example, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), administered jointly by the World Bank, the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) and the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP), arranges and funds co-operative projects in developing countries to reverse global environmental degradation. Technology development, transfer and capacity- building are at the core of its mission.10 65. The concept of an international science organisation could plausibly be expanded in the direction of technology co-operation. In the alternative, since technology co-operation is central to the purpose for which the OECD was founded, a new or expanded operational unit there might fulfil such a mission equally well. Two major functions can be envisioned. For one, it is possible that an international capability could provide funding for international technology co-operation projects. This, of course, entails many, difficult issues of administration and national contributions to the multilateral fund. A perhaps more realistic alternative is to devote resources to assessing the need for, feasibility and modalities of international technology co-operation and then facilitating its realisation. Using the IMS example, one could envision many of the current management structures and agreements having been developed under the auspices of an international entity, had one existed and been focused on such a role.    9   See Robert White, A Potent Global Agency for Science,  cited in references. 10 The issue of technology co-operation between the developed and developing worlds in the environmental context is addressed at length in George R. Heaton, et al, Missing Links, cited in references.   66. The following language inserted into Principle I might be considered to accomplish this purpose: I. Member countries facilitate international bilateral and multilateral collaboration in technology development between their respective industries...; an international organisation be given the mandate and resources to facilitate international multilateral co-operation. [Additions in emphasis] 5.4 Financing 67. The Principles refer only obliquely to the issue of financing. Principle VII speaks of fair and equitable contributions as a subject about which participants need to come to an understanding. Such contributions can, of course, encompass technical skills and technology as well as money. In a number of respects, this reticence may be a sensible approach. At the same time, however, the issue of financing, especially from governments, is of such pre-eminent importance as to merit some additional consideration. 68. The IMS experience in particular raises the problem of disparate contributions across regions. At the moment, for example, it appears that little or no public resources will be available from the U.S., while other regions seem to have made significant commitments. (See section 3. 5 above) When such disparities are coupled with the principle of self-funding by each region now built into the IMS TOR, it raises the possibility that intra-regional co-operation, not a truly international approach, will become the project's dominant reality. Going farther into the IMS history, it is worth recalling that the project began with the promise of Japanese funding for work throughout the world. This explains the genesis of the regional funding principle. 69. Given the sensitivities to free cross-regional funding that are now a reality, at least two alternative approaches suggest themselves as means through which these diverse concerns might be ameliorated. One might be to commit funds and funding decisions to a multilateral entity, which would then attempt to disburse them not only on the basis of technical merit but also in order to achieve some geographical parity. While not exactly analogous, the redistribution of capital and technical resources through various UN agencies and multilateral development banks could offer lessons in this regard. 70. A second approach might permit cross-regional funding -- but only in cases where funding from a proposed research project's natural regional home was not available. In this situation, the research collaborators could apply to whatever funding source seemed most appropriate. In either case, it would be up to the research partners to decide whether to embark on such a funding strategy. 71. These two approaches could be incorporated into Principle VII with new language as follows: VII. The partners in the collaboration come to an understanding on the protection of intellectual property rights, as well as fair and equitable contributions to projects, access to the results of the collaboration, dissemination of information and access to markets. Partners may reach an understanding to seek financial support outside of their country or region when adequate financing therein is unavailable.	technology co-operation *** technology co-operation *** international co-operation *** private sector *** technology diffusion *** development and diffusion *** economic growth *** technology co-operation *** public sector *** private sector *** international co-operation *** economic growth *** international co-operation *** environmental policy *** international technology co-operation *** technology diffusion *** development and diffusion *** private sector *** economic growth *** international technology co-operation *** intellectual property *** international technology co-operation *** international collaboration *** international co-operation *** international collaboration *** private sector *** private sector *** international technology co-operation *** international co-operation *** intellectual property *** international co-operation *** international technology co-operation *** technology development *** technology co-operation *** technology co-operation *** international technology co-operation *** international technology co-operation *** technology co-operation *** technology development *** intellectual property *** international technology co-operation	policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)8	BEST PRACTICES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICY	1995	S	Technology and innovation policy initiatives in OECD Member countries have in recent years placed a much stronger emphasis on the economic impacts of public support to Science and Technology, particularly with respect to fostering productivity and competitiveness. A serious issue, however, is whether, in pursuing these objectives with its current instruments, technology and innovation policy helps also to resolve  another key problem in many OECD member countries, namely persistent unemployment. Today, a strategic goal of technology and innovation policy is to leverage the effects of macroeconomic, labour and product market policies  in  achieving  more  job-creating  growth. This  raises  two  important  questions: How should employment concerns be taken into account in formulating technology and innovation policy priorities and strategies? How should they influence the choice of policy instruments? In this context the activity aims at: clarifying  the challenges for technology  policy  makers arising from  persistent unemployment and problems of policy coordination; examining the impact on job creation of different strategies and instruments to promote innovation; identifying and analysing some best practice policy measures from this point of view, which have emerged in various national contexts, in order to draw useful lessons for the Member  countries as a whole. Three areas of work should be undertaken. (a) A conceptual paper will be prepared by the Secretariat: This paper will seek to provide a framework for analysing forms of technological change, policies relevant for such change, and potential employment effects. (b) An empirical study will be based on a specific survey of policy measures and instruments in Member countries. (c) A synthesis report will be prepared on employment-promoting technology and innovation policy. The synthesis activity will seek to draw together the overall conclusions from this work. National differences and similarities in the ranking of technology policy priorities will be highlighted and taken into account when drawing general conclusions from the inventory of best practice policy measures and approaches. It will deal also with what can be called the implicit dimension of technology policy, namely those policy actions in other areas which either impact directly on the trajectory of technological development, or impact on the effectiveness of technology policy actions. These policy areas can be seen in a broad perspective: they include fiscal and monetary policies, physical infrastructure policies, policies with respect to standards and intellectual property rights, and policies for education and training.	economic impacts *** policy instruments *** job creation *** best practices *** policy measures *** technological change *** policy measures *** best practices *** policy measures *** technology development *** policy areas *** intellectual property *** best practices	objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)9/REV1	Future work of the group .	1995	M	Outputs and work in progress: The TIP Group has been entrusted with the following major activities of the current (1995-1996) DSTI work programme: Activity 3.2 National innovation systems, .  Activity 5.2 Effectiveness of technology policies, .  Activity 6.2 Internationalisation of technology. Under each of these broad headings, the Group has undertaken a number of more specific projects which can be classified according to four categories of work:.  Policy assessment and recommendations, Sharing of experience on best policy practices, Analytical work required for policy formulation, Co-ordination with other Groups, including statistical work. Under the activity Effectiveness of technology policy, the Groups work contributed to the interim report on Technology, Productivity and Job creation submitted to the OECD Council at Ministerial Level (May 1995), and will prepare policy conclusions of the activity on the Effectiveness of technology policy from an employment perspective (draft submission in early 1996), with a view to their inclusion in the final report on the G-7 project on Technology, Productivity and Job creation. Under the activity Internationalisation of technology,  the Group prepared a  Discussion paper, a Background paper and draft Recommendations concerning Principles for Facilitating International Co- operation for the CSTP meeting at Ministerial level (September 1995). Exchange of information and views on specific aspects of national support policies constitutes a highly valued recurrent activity of the Group, which contributes to implementation of all three main work areas (National innovation systems, Effectiveness of technology policy, and Internationalisation of technology). Such exchanges have usually taken place within the context of ad hoc symposia/meetings, often organised back-to-back with plenary sessions. The following themes have been covered: International technology cooperation (May 1994), Government  technology  foresight  exercises  (September 1994) ; Fiscal measures to promote Research and Development and innovation (January 1995) ; Venture capital will be the subject of an ad hoc meeting planned for November 1995 (back-to- back with the sixth meeting). Under the activity National innovation systems, the Group completed three major reports on Technology flows in national innovation systems, National systems for financing innovation, and on Accessing and expanding the knowledge base -- a conceptual framework for comparing the distribution power of national innovation systems. The Group has launched empirical tests of this framework in some 15 countries; a report on the results of this experiment will be presented to the next CSTP meeting . The ultimate objective of the project is to develop a new framework of indicators for chabadi chabado makers to assess and compre knowledge distribution power, as new tools for policy diagnosis and formulation. Under the activity Internationalisation of technology, the Group completed analytical reports on International co-operation in technology Research and Development projects (preliminary review on IRRI, Eureka and Micromachine project) and on International technology co-operation: lessons and principles from the IMS project	national innovation systems *** policy formulation *** policy practices *** job creation *** technology co-operation *** national innovation systems *** venture capital *** national innovation systems *** knowledge base *** international technology co-operation	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(95)9/REV1	Future work of the group .	1995	M	Possible future work : (i) agree on an unifying theme;   the Secretariat suggests  that Technology  and innovation  policy in a knowledge-based economy -- new concepts, principles and indicators for policy making could be such a corner stone ; (ii) deal not only with the international and national dimensions of technology  and  innovation  policy issues, but also with relation between the two ; (iii) acknowledge that to fulfill its mandate the Group has to undertake different types of complementary tasks; Delegations generally favour the categorisation which has been already referred to above, i.e.: policy assessment and recommendation, Exchange of information and views on best  policy  practices  in  specific  fields, Analytical work required for policy formulation. Possible themes under Policy assessment and recommendations : the role of each Research and Development performing sector such as industry, universities, and national laboratories; the role of government in the performance or support of  Research and Development  activities,  including securing financial resources; the nature of co-operation between industries, universities and governments (national laboratories, e.g. the aims of co-operation and institutional impediments to them); the respective roles of national and international support programmes in technology and innovation policy. In-depth consideration of the policy implications arising from the project on Technology, Productivity and Job creation. Possible themes under : Sharing of experience on Best policy practices : Possible topics for future thematic meetings have already been suggested by some Delegations.

DSTI/STP/TIP(96)1/REV1	PROPOSED WORK PLAN FOR 1997_1998	1996	M	The proposed TIP work plan for 1997/98 is presented in the attached fact sheets under two headings : Technology and Innovation: Best Practice Policies for the Knowledge-Based Economy. This continues two activities from the 1995/96 work programme on National Innovation Systems and The Effectiveness of Technology Policy ; International Technology Issues -- Co-operation and Friction. This continues the activity of the 1995/1996 work programme on Internationalisation of Technology. Activity 1 continues work on best practice policies for technology and innovation developed in connection with the horizontal study on Technology, Productivity and Job Creation presented to Ministers in May 1996. It will compare national responses to common problems and identify policy approaches for stimulating technology development and diffusion in knowledge-based economies. This includes inputs on : (i) Technology Diffusion : The identification of best practices in technology diffusion will focus  on the Thematic Review of government policies to increase the absorptive capacity of firms, particularly smaller firms, in acquiring and using technology, e.g. through information and consulting services, management training, electronic networking, demonstration projects. (ii) National Innovation Systems : The definition and comparison of national innovation systems will build on the synthesis report of the results of the national pilot case studies. Further work will focus on identifying best practices in national innovation systems, particularly new forms of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in support of Research and Development and innovation. The subject of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in national innovation systems will be discussed in a one-day Thematic Workshop in 1997/98. (iii) G7 Follow-Up: Analysis will continue in 1997/98 to identify best practices in policy areas identified in the study on Technology, Productivity and Job Creation.   This will build on TIP work in   the areas of Research and Development tax provisions and financing innovation. It will include results from ongoing work on technology diffusion and national innovation systems, such as PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in development of advanced technology. There will also be a broad examination of best practice approaches to project selection and design and assessment methodologies for evaluating and comparing best practices. Activity 2 will continue the development and implementation of the Principles for International Co-operation in Technology Involving Enterprises adopted at the CSTP Ministerial meeting in September 1995. The objectives of this activity are to deepen the examination of issues arising from the increasing internationalisation of Research and Development and technology development and the implications for governments and the private sector. Analysis will focus on identifying barriers to international technology co-operation and recommending approaches to overcoming such obstacles. This would include issues relating  to trade-related aspects of technology policy, foreign participation in government-funded technology programmes, and technology and foreign investment. In addition, other areas of work undertaken in the context of the work programme of the Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry will be presented for discussion by the TIP group. In 1997/98, this will include: (i) Indicators for the Knowledge-Based Economy. Follow-up to the 1996 workshop  on  Indicators for the Knowledge-Based Economy will involve co-operation with the Group of  National  Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI) in the area of innovation surveys and developing indicators for mapping national innovation systems ; (ii) Science, Technology and Industry Outlook. It is proposed that one of the special themes in the 1998 Science, Technology and Industry Outlook will analyse the diffusion and effects of information technologies on productivity, employment and output in basic industries, such as steel and textiles. (iii) Regulatory Reform and Innovation. A report will be prepared for the horizontal programme on regulatory reform on the Effects of Regulatory Reform on Industrial Competitiveness and  Innovation. This will identify best practices in  regulation for stimulating innovation in  industry,  such as reforms to intellectual property rights regimes and development of technology-driving regulations.	policy practices *** best practices *** knowledge-based economy *** national innovation systems *** job creation *** policy practices *** best practices *** policy approaches *** development and diffusion *** technology development *** knowledge-based economy *** best practices *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems *** support research *** public private partnerships *** best practices *** new forms of innovation *** national innovation systems *** public private partnerships *** national innovation systems *** job creation *** best practices *** policy areas *** tax incentives *** public private partnerships *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems *** best practices *** international technology co-operation *** private sector *** internationalisation of research *** technology development *** international technology co-operation *** technology programmes *** foreign direct investment *** knowledge-based economy *** national innovation systems *** knowledge-based economy *** information technology *** regulatory reform *** regulatory reform *** intellectual property *** best practices *** stimulating innovation	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)10/REV1	GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES FOR VENTURE CAPITAL	1996	R	1. Governments can stimulate the supply of venture capital by modifying fiscal and regulatory frameworks. In addition, OECD governments are implementing a number of more direct programmes to mobilise venture capital in support of small, innovative firms. These programmes aim to fill funding gaps that prevent small businesses, particularly technology-based firms, from obtaining sufficient capital and from producing public benefits in terms of innovation and job creation. Government venture capital schemes aim to remedy deficiencies in private capital markets, to leverage private sector financing and to nurture technology-based firms over the longer-term. 2. There are broadly three types of government programmes: 1) direct supply of capital to venture capital firms or small firms; 2) financial incentives for investing in venture capital funds or small firms; and 3) investor rules controlling types of venture capital investors. The most high-profile and high-risk way of providing financial resources to venture capital funds or small firms is through equity investments and low-interest loans. The number of such programmes is limited but increasing in the OECD area. Financial incentives are more widely used and are intended to stimulate private sector investment; these incentives most often take the form of tax credits or deductions, guarantees of loans taken out by venture capital firms or by small start-ups, or guarantees of equity investments made by venture capital firms. Investor regulations, the third category of programmes, are now being reviewed and revised in many OECD countries in order to broaden the types of institutions, particularly pension funds, permitted or encouraged to make venture capital investments. 3. There are numerous factors to be taken into account when designing and implementing these venture capital schemes in order to ensure they fulfil their original aims and are directed to their desired targets. Most of these factors are specific to the type of scheme in question, but the following are some general guiding principles: Design -- The configuration of schemes must consider the nature and extent of the investment incentives, whether they are aimed at venture capital firms or directly at small firms, the stages of investment to be targeted, the risk factors involved and the leveraging effects on private capital. Additionality -- Venture capital programmes should seek to stimulate private sector funding and create a commercially viable market, which would allow government schemes to be phased out as private sources of capital expand. Management -- Successful venture capital programmes are those which elicit private sector participation in the design stage and where the private sector plays a professional role in the programmes management. Process -- The process whereby a small firm, investor or venture capital fund applies for an incentive should be simple, straightforward and not unnecessarily long. Transparency -- Steps should be taken to disseminate widely information about government programmes to venture capitalists, investors and enterprises. Evaluation -- Venture capital programmes should be evaluated and assessed on a regular basis. One criteria for measuring success is the extent to which venture capital funds or small firms are created which can operate on a commercial basis, i.e. generate an attractive rate of return.	venture capital *** venture capital *** innovative firms *** job creation *** technology based firms *** venture capital *** private sector *** technology based firms *** government programmes *** venture capital *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** tax incentives *** private sector *** venture capital *** venture capital *** venture capital *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** private sector *** venture capital *** private sector *** venture capital *** small and medium sized firms *** government programmes *** venture capital *** venture capital *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** government programmes	firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)11	NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS:  PROPOSALS FOR PHASE II	1996	S	Background. The OECD programme on national innovation systems, initiated in June 1994, is undertaken under the aegis of the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) of the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP). This project aims at developing and testing a conceptual framework for analysing the processes of knowledge creation, distribution and use in national systems of innovation.  It seeks to map and to compare knowledge flows in national innovation systems with a view  to developing new insights into the formulation of technology and innovation policy in knowledge-based economies. A conceptual framework for national innovation systems has thus far been developed and tested through eight pilot country case studies in 1995/1996 (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). A synthesis report summarises  the  main results of these country case studies.  Their purpose was mainly to: develop a common ground for research on national systems of innovation; experiment with different analytical approaches; assess the availability of data to compare the knowledge distribution power of national systems of innovation and develop appropriate indicators;  and derive conclusions concerning 'systemic approaches' to innovation and technology policy. Phase I of the project underlined several weaknesses in the methodology: 1) the availability of data and quantitative information to depict the various knowledge flows varies considerably from country to country and is far from complete; 2) there is as yet no generally agreed-upon approach to mapping national innovation systems; and 3) it has proved difficult to produce general indicators of the knowledge distribution power of a national innovation system. These methodological problems have so far hindered problem identification and the relevance to policy-making. Although many country studies pointed at potential bottlenecks and mismatches within their innovation system, these descriptions still fall short of providing a basis for international comparison and benchmarking as well as for identifying problems and best practices in innovation policy. The second phase will comprise three aspects: (1) work by the Secretariat to increase the comparability of national approaches; (2) an attempt to focus the country studies of the second phase on a common set of questions; The following are the areas proposed for common study in the second phase: Determining the borders of innovation systems , Analysing the knowledge base of the innovation system, Analysing the institutional setting of innovation systems, Identifying the characteristics of innovative firms and 3) the development of focus groups to explore specific analytical areas or methodologies: Mapping human resources, Mapping institutional linkages, Mapping the innovative behaviour of firms.	national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** knowledge flows *** national innovation systems *** knowledge-based economy *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** knowledge flows *** national innovation systems *** innovation systems *** best practices *** human resources *** innovative firms *** innovation systems *** knowledge base *** national innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_human_resources *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)12	INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ISSUES:  PROPOSALS FOR WORK	1996	S	The Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) has included in its 1997/98  work programme a general activity on International Technology Issues -- Co-operation and Friction . The following are proposals for specific projects in five areas relating to international technology issues. (1) intellectual property rights: patents and international Research and Development consortia. Differences in national patent systems can cause uncertainties and potential frictions for firms conducting collaborative research and development at the international level. This includes both private Research and Development joint ventures and government-funded Research and Development consortia. At present, provisions concerning the allocation of patent rights for the results of joint research are generally worked out on a project-by-project basis. This work would examine current practices with regard to protection of intellectual property from joint international research and the extent to which intellectual property restrictions could discriminate against participation by foreign firms. This could contribute to the identification of best practices with regard to the sharing of patent rights in international research as well as the possible development of general guidelines for intellectual property rights relating to Research and Development consortia. (2) foreign access to technology programmes: practices regarding participation of foreign companies and their subsidiaries in government-funded technology and Research and Development programmes. There is concern that rules governing foreign company access to government-sponsored  Research and Development programmes and research laboratories are unduly restrictive and sometimes confusing and non- transparent. Governments may limit foreign participation for reasons of national security, lack of recIntellectual Property Rightocity, ineligibility for funding, technology competition or to obtain leverage for other international policy goals. This activity could lead to broad OECD guidelines regarding access to publically-funded technology efforts in the interest of international technology co-operation. (3) the role of small   and medium-sized enterprises, Due to their limited financial and technical resources, small and medium-sized enterprises have not played a substantial role in collaborative research and development at the international level. In some countries, the small average size of enterprises is a chief impediment to successful  international  technology co-operation. To the extent that small size is a constraint in engaging in international technology programmes, this may reduce the proportion of innovative firms which are contributing to technological progress in the OECD area. (4) technology and trade: The issues addressed by the Forum  included the nature of international competition in technology-based sectors and whether special trade  rules would be beneficial; barriers to market access for high-technology products and sectors; the trade impacts of government programmes to foster domestic high-technology industries; the effects of technology procurement programmes on trade; and trade-related technology transfer requirements. (5) globalisation of research and development. An area of increasing interest to OECD governments is the globalisation of research and development as multinational corporations internationalise their research operations and locate more of their Research and Development abroad. Some countries are concerned about the delocalisationof research and the longer- term implications for their domestic innovative capacity. There are many reasons why companies conduct research abroad: to be closer to markets which can inform the research process; to be closer to specialised research or knowledge centres to build on linkages in core business areas; to acquire specialised technical services, labour skills or expertise; and/or to conduct research and product development in a more favourable regulatory climate. Particular attention will be given to  the trend for firms to locate Research and Development functions near major research universities, technical centres and large science facilities and the emergence of specialised competence centres.	international research *** intellectual property *** international level *** collaborative research and development *** funded research *** joint ventures *** business research and development *** intellectual property *** international research *** intellectual property *** foreign firms *** international research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** best practices *** development programmes *** technology programmes *** development programmes *** international technology co-operation *** international level *** collaborative research and development *** technology co-operation *** innovative firms *** technology programmes *** government programmes *** technology transfer *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** innovation capacity *** product development	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)13/REV1	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: PATENTS AND INNOVATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT	1996	R	1. Intellectual property is a generic term which refers to the rights to the products of human creativity, including scientific discoveries, industrial design, and literary and artistic works. Intellectual property policy is intended to set an equilibrium between two objectives: 1) rewarding creators and inventors for innovation, and 2) promoting access by business and the public to science, technology and culture. This paper discusses issues that emerge at the interface of patents and innovation, particularly in the international context. Patents protect the inventions that business exploits as a result of research and development and are an important incentive to research and development and to innovation in general. The term patent comes from the first Letters Patent, which granted an inventor or importer of a new technology the sole right to use it for a period sufficiently long to establish his business. 2. There are many significant differences among national patent systems, that are due to broad legal and regulatory frameworks as well as to the practical conditions of implementation. These differences affect, in particular, the nature of the patentee and the date at which protection begins; the extent to which, and the moment at which, the new knowledge is disseminated and becomes publicly available; the ability of competitors to challenge a patent application or a new patent; the scope of protection and its duration; the cost and complexity of the patenting process; and the extent to which enforcement is ensured. These differences affect the innovation system because they influence the conditions under which an invention becomes known and the ability of others to utilise the new knowledge in further research and development. 3. These national differences in patent regimes, together with the effects of information technology and increasing competition at the global level, raise issues regarding the efficacy of patenting in the current era. When considering the costs, complexity and levels of protection of patenting, firms might, for example, choose not to patent and use secrecy instead to protect innovations. They might hesitate to engage in joint international research ventures because of uncertainties in the assignment of patent rights among prospective partners. They might also refrain from foreign research investments due to problems in enforcement or awarding of patent rights. Exploitation of research results might be endangered by the use of patent laws as barriers to trade or by the patenting practices of firms that attempt to block technological developments by competitors. Small and medium-sized firms - whose future may hinge on the exploitation of one strategic patent - are especially vulnerable in view of their limited resources and reach. These considerations represent powerful arguments towards greater homogenisation and simplification of the international patent environment, particularly to stimulate continuing innovation and diffusion of technology.	intellectual property *** scientific discoveries *** intellectual property *** new technologies *** new knowledge *** new knowledge *** innovation systems *** information technology *** international research *** intellectual property *** research investments *** intellectual property *** technology development *** patent law *** research results *** technology diffusion *** diffusion of innovation *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)14/REV1	FOREIGN ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMMES: BACKGROUND REPORT	1996	R	1. Based on the limited data available, it appears that participation by foreign firms in government-funded Research and Development and technology programmes is increasing in the OECD area, although on a small scale. Participation is most often by domiciled foreign firms (those with an Research and Development or production presence in the country), while participation by non-domiciled foreign firms is still relatively rare. In general, access for foreign firms may be restricted for strategic purposes as well as for concerns relating to economic and technological competitiveness. This paper reviews the rules and status of access of foreign firms to the major national technology programmes in the United States, Europe and Japan; it is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of foreign participation in all technology activities or in all OECD countries. 2. There are no clear national, regional or international rules governing the eligibility of foreign firms for access to government-funded technology programmes. Rules and participation tend to differ from country to country and from programme to programme, which gives rise to a wide variety of situations. Access by foreign firms may be negotiated on a bilateral basis for certain projects. Access decisions may also be based on criteria relating to: 1) recIntellectual Property Rightocal or comparable treatment of domestic firms in the home countries of foreign firms; and 2) domestic exploitation in the host country of the results of the Research and Development programme. Although such provisions may be included in the authorising legislation or frameworks for technology programmes, it is unclear to what extent they are applied in practice. 3. Discrepancies in the treatment of domestic and foreign firms with regard to government-funded technology programmes, although intended to help capture Research and Development spillovers at the national level, are generally not conducive to international technology co-operation. Three aspects of these programmes have been highlighted as potential barriers to technology co-operation involving enterprises: RecIntellectual Property Rightocity -- RecIntellectual Property Rightocity requirements (i.e. that domestic firms be granted equal access to national technology programmes in the foreign firms home country) may be specified in government-funded technology programmes. In some cases, these requirements have extended beyond technology access to foreign investment conditions and the protection of intellectual property rights. Exploitation -- Criteria for technology access may be included which relate to economic performance or exploitation (e.g. that foreign firms exploit or manufacture in the host country innovations resulting from access to technology programmes). These conditions may be part of the intellectual property or funding provisions of technology programmes. Transparency -- Foreign participation in national technology programmes may be regulated by a variety of directives, agreements and requirements within individual countries. Access by foreign firms may be discouraged by a dearth of information and lack of transparency of the rules relating to their participation in national technology programmes	funded research *** foreign firms *** technology programmes *** foreign firms *** foreign firms *** foreign firms *** technology programmes *** foreign firms *** technology programmes *** foreign firms *** host country *** research results *** foreign firms *** home country *** technology programmes *** foreign firms *** international technology co-operation *** technology programmes *** technology co-operation *** foreign firms *** home country *** technology programmes *** intellectual property *** foreign direct investment *** host country *** foreign firms *** technology programmes *** intellectual property *** technology programmes *** technology programmes *** foreign firms *** technology programmes *** technology programmes	policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)15/REV3	SEOUL CONFERENCE ON FACILITATING INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CO-OPERATION	1996	W2	The title of the conference  Facilitating International Technology Co-operation in a Globalised Knowledge-based Economy  reflects the aim to derive practical policy implications for international chabadi chabado in the context of knowledge-based economies and increasing globalisation of science and technology. International technology co-operation can be considered as a  mechanism  which complements market operations in the exchange of knowledge; this co-operative mechanism tends  to be important particularly in the globalised knowledge-based economy.  The agenda topics are intended  to build upon and help develop the related work programme items of the CSTP and the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP), particularly the activity on International Technology Issues: Co-operation and Friction. It will also further the co-operative work on international technology issues with the OECD Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC). Topics will be examined from three standpoints: 1) what are the issues? 2) what mechanisms or barriers exist? and 3) what are the policy recommendations?	knowledge-based economy *** international technology co-operation *** knowledge-based economy *** international technology co-operation *** international technology co-operation	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)2	TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICIES: SYNTHESIS OF RESPONSES TO BEST PRACTICES QUESTIONNAIRE	1996	R	This document provides an overview and account of country responses to the questionnaire on Best Practices in Technology and Innovation Policy from an Employment Perspective. Among the common goals of technology and innovation policies shared by countries are: stimulating business research and innovation efforts, promoting new forms of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, mobilising private finance to support new technology-based firms and improving the efficiency of technology transfer networks. Countries identified the following main challenges to formulating and implementing technology and innovation policies: Globalisation and increasing international competition for access to knowledge; Changing business needs and mismatch with the public knowledge infrastructure; Changing RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT demands and need for more public/private co-operation; Shortage of research personnel and need for adaptation of educational systems; Requirements for broader approaches to technology diffusion beyond traditional equipment- embodied technology transfer mechanisms; and Need to identify technology and innovation policy priorities, better co-ordinate programmes and increase their cost-efficiency. Best practices in technology and innovation policy are those which are cost-efficient in achieving a policy objective common to several countries. In general, the best practice component of a programme or measure should be separable from elements which are more context- or country-specific and should be transferable to other countries. Countries identified the following as areas where it would be most useful to identify best practices in technology and innovation policies: Providing incentives to business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT efforts;Financing innovation in chabadu chabados;Building PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for the knowledge base; Developing advanced technology;Disseminating technology; andAssessing technology and innovation policies.	best practices *** new forms of innovation *** public private partnerships *** business research and development *** technology based firms *** new technologies *** technology transfer *** technology diffusion *** technology transfer *** best practices *** best practices *** public private partnerships *** business research and development *** small and medium sized firms *** best practices *** knowledge base *** best practices	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)3	SUMMARY REPORT: AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON VENTURE CAPITAL	1996	W2	Industry access to finance is a crucial element in the innovation process for translating the results of research and development into commercial outcomes. Venture capital is a specific type of finance provided by certain firms who invest alongside management in young companies that are not quoted on the stock market. Venture capital investments generally involve a long time-frame, an element of risk, a partnership with management and returns in the form of capital gains rather than dividends. Venture capitalists are needed to support high-risk investments in small, technology-based firms, which are often passed over by large companies and traditional financial institutions. Most venture capital schemes are independent funds which raise capital from financial institutions. However, some financial institutions have their own venture capital funds (captives), and, in some countries, there is an informal venture capital market of private individuals (business angels) and large companies (corporate venturing). The venture capital industry is well established in the United States, where it is oriented to technology-based sectors and consists of a range of investors, including pension funds, insurance companies and private individuals. The European venture capital industry is younger, oriented to mainstream sectors and dominated by banks. Japanese venture capital firms are mostly subsidiaries of financial institutions, which invest in established firms and provide mainly loan finance. Although policies and programmes will vary with the economic and institutional characteristics of countries, the following are best practices which governments can undertake to foster venture capital markets:  (1) Creating an investment environment. Governments can create a fiscal and legal environment for stimulating the supply of venture capital, including measures to encourage longer-term venture capital investments by pension and insurance funds and tax incentives for venture capital investments by individuals or business angels. (2) Reducing risks for investors. Governments can stimulate the creation of venture capital funds oriented to technology investments through appropriate tax incentives, seed financing schemes, coverage of a proportion of investment losses, and funding pre-finance technology appraisals and audits. (3) Increasing liquidity. Governments can take steps to ease exit by institutional investors in start-up ventures through, for example, facilitating reinvestment and encouraging the creation of active secondary stock markets favouring high-growth technology-based companies. (4) Facilitating entrepreneurship. Governments can implement initiatives to encourage new high-technology start-ups, including risk-bearing tax regimes, royalty-linked loan schemes, information and counselling services and support for business angel networks.	research results *** innovation process *** venture capital *** venture capital *** technology based firms *** venture capital *** venture capital *** business angels *** venture capital *** venture capital *** venture capital *** venture capital *** best practices *** venture capital *** venture capital *** business angels *** tax incentives *** venture capital *** tax incentives *** business angels *** venture capital	policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)3/ADD1	WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS: AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON VENTURE CAPIT AL	1996	W2	the new financial environment generates intermediaries specialised in screening, choosing and managing technological innovation projects. These intermediary functions are growing both within large financial business institutions and via the more specialised venture capital funds. These intermediaries fulfil a fundamental agency role in funding innovations. However, their development has been uneven at both the national and international levels. Challenges and prospects for the venture capital industry. Challenge 1: Encourage dynamic entrepreneurship and management. Challenge 2: Provide competitive stock markets for smaller and growing companies. Challenge 3: Develop and channel sources of long-term capital. Challenge 4: Tax rewards for private equity investment. Challenge 5: Provide appropriate investment fund structures. Challenge 6: Facilitate the transfer of company ownership. Challenge 7: Develop investment into start-up and innovative companies. Challenge 8: Develop the markets in countries where private equity emerges. The technology-based small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) evolves through a succession of stages of corporate growth. Four stages can be identified through which the growing firm is likely to pass. The pre-start-up, or RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, stage involves attempts to determine the commercial applicability of the proposed product or service. The start-up stage involves the development of the initial product, demonstration of its commercial viability, initial marketing and securing the first sales. At the initial growth stage the company has completed development of the product line, is experiencing growing sales and is operating profitably. However, profits are insufficient to meet the expanding working capital requirements or to finance the purchase of plant and equipment and the recruitment of key staff in various functional areas in order to expand. A company which reaches the sustained growth stage will be growing rapidly. It has a variety of customers and a range of products and services. Profits and cash flows are sufficient to meet the majority of the firm's needs but new commercial opportunities are continually being presented. Of much greater significance as a source of equity finance for chabadu chabados in general, and for technology based firms (TBFs) in particular, is the informal venture capital market. The informal venture capital market comprises private investors - alternatively termed private venture capitalists but more commonly referred to as 'business angels'. The under-development of the informal venture capital market is a major gap in the spectrum of funds for smaller companies and a major barrier contribution to barriers to growth. we outline a multi-faceted approach to stimulate the informal venture capital market, comprising the following elements: networking strategies, tax strategies, securities legislation , awareness raising and education . In the Neterlands, measures are to be introduced under the income tax and corporation tax systems to encourage the supply of risk capital ; for the establishment of five to six participation companies for new technology-based firms (NTBF) ; for a greater use of the The Technical Development Credit Scheme, and the revised Small and Medium Entreprise Credit Guarantees Decree.  In Canada, policy measures to encourage venture capital are : Taxation of capital gains, Government-owned venture funds, Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations.	venture capital *** international level *** venture capital *** technology based firms *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** business angels *** venture capital *** venture capital *** venture capital *** technology based firms *** tax systems *** new technologies *** venture capital *** policy measures	firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)4	NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: REPORT ON PILOT CASE STUDIES	1995	R	1. National innovation systems can be defined as the networks of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions determine the ability of a country to diffuse knowledge and technology and which influence national innovative performance. This paper summarises the results of pilot case studies of eight OECD countries to map the interactions among these institutions and to track flows of knowledge with the aim of identifying those systems with the greatest ability to distribute knowledge. The lack of uniform methodologies and indicators limits our understanding of national innovation systems, and it is still particularly difficult to correlate the configuration of a national system of innovation and its knowledge distribution power with measures of economic performance. 2. Despite these limitations, the following are the preliminary findings of the pilot case studies:  In most countries, there exist clusters of inter-related industries who interact through dense knowledge networks and who show good economic performance. These clusters are not always in high-technology sectors or are Research and Development-intensive;  The private sector innovates primarily through internal Research and Development, although the use of external sources of knowledge (i.e. public research sector, international sources) in the innovation process is slowly increasing;  Joint industry research collaborations are increasing and have mostly positive impacts on innovative performance;  While there is a growing incidence and variety of collaborations between industry and the public research sector (universities and publically-funded research institutes), these do not appear to have a significant impact on the innovative performance of firms.  High levels of personnel mobility and interactions within and between public and private institutions has a positive effect on innovative performance, particularly the ability of firms to adapt and use new technologies. The findings of the pilot case studies have important implications for government innovation and technology policies. Efforts should continue to design public/private technology partnerships which are relevant to industry and can positively influence innovative performance. In the place of pure technology transfer mechanisms, programmes which improve industrys ability to absorb technologies and which match industry needs with the research capacities of public and university research institutes may be more beneficial. Such programmes should focus on traditional industrial sectors as well as new growth sectors and build on existing knowledge networks in industrial clusters. Government programmes which maximise informal contacts and knowledge networks among public and private institutions and enhance personnel mobility should also help build more effective national innovation systems	innovation performance *** private sector *** national innovation systems *** technological knowledge *** diffusion of knowledge *** knowledge flows *** national innovation systems *** private sector *** international research *** innovation performance *** funded research *** collaborative research *** innovation process *** research organisations *** public research sector *** innovation performance *** new technologies *** personnel mobility *** innovation performance *** research organisations *** technology transfer *** business sector *** government programmes *** national innovation systems *** personnel mobility *** national innovation systems	objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_human_resources *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)5/REV1	Research and Development TAX TREATMENT IN OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES: A COMPARISON	1995	R	1. In many OECD countries, Research and Development tax incentives to stimulate private sector research spending are a significant element of technology and innovation policy. A B-index Methodology is used here to compare the relative importance of Research and Development tax support across countries. The value of the B-index depends on the tax treatment of Research and Development in a country and is based on the before-tax income required to break-even on a $1 Research and Development outlay. The more favourable its tax treatment of Research and Development, the lower is a countrys B-index and, other things being equal, the greater the amount of research that will be conducted by its corporate residents. While the B-index is a useful analytical and comparative tool, it is based on a number of methodological assumptions; it also does not consider the full range of taxes in a country or the effects of other types of technology policies on research spending. An important issue for consideration is the appropriate role for Research and Development tax incentives relative to other types of policy instruments. 2. The initial comparison of Research and Development tax provisions according to the B-index methodology indicates that, for a large manufacturing company, Spain, Canada and Australia have the lowest B-index, which should theoretically generate the highest levels of business research spending. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Germany, Italy and New Zealand were found to have the highest B-index, which would offer the least incentives to business research spending. The comparisons for a small manufacturing company show that Italy, Canada and the Netherlands have the lowest B-index and thus the most generous Research and Development tax provisions for smaller firms. 3. A number of trends can be identified in the use of Research and Development tax provisions in the OECD countries:  All but one country allows current business expenditures on Research and Development to be fully deducted the year they are incurred.  About half of the countries provide some type of additional Research and Development tax credit or incentive. There is a trend to the use of incremental tax credits and more targeted approaches such as those favouring basic research.  Six countries have special provisions in their Research and Development tax credits favouring research by smaller firms.  There are a growing number of Research and Development tax incentives being offered at the sub-national (provincial and state) levels.  Most countries make incremental rather than radical changes to their Research and Development tax provisions with the intention of improving their effectiveness over time.	private sector *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** policy instruments *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** research use *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** basic research *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** tax incentives	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives
DSTI/STP/TIP(96)7/REV1	TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION: A TYPOLOGY OF PROGRAMMES	1996	R	Technology diffusion programmes are taking on new importance in the OECD countries as the key to maximising the employment benefits of new technologies. Employment performance in the short- and long-term is affected by the ability of firms and sectors to identify, absorb and implement technology. The process of technical change is biased against the inability to learn, on the part of both individuals and firms. Just as wage flexibility moderates the link between productivity and employment, firm flexibility moderates the link between technology and employment. Technology diffusion programmes can ensure that technology makes a positive contribution to job creation through enhancing the adaptability and flexibility of key actors in the economy in the face of rapid technical change. There exist in the OECD countries many different types of technology diffusion programmes, mostly implemented by governments to address market and systemic failures adversely affecting the innovative performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For the purpose of identifying best practices in technology diffusion, one can categorise programmes according to: 1) technology targets, or the specific elements that may be highlighted in the diffusion process, such as particular technologies, industrial sectors, institutions or geographical regions; and 2) technology services, or the types of services which are provided such as technical assistance, information or training. OECD countries now have programmes aimed at specific targets, those which supply one type of service to a number of targets and those which combine various targets and services in a single scheme. These programmes combine to form a technology diffusion system, which is an important element in a countrys national innovation system. The general concept of technology diffusion has evolved considerably over the past two decades, from the transfer of technology embodied in equipment to include the enhancement of the technology- related learning capabilities of firms. The following are the preliminary conclusions to be drawn from this review of technology diffusion programmes: (1) Technology diffusion programmes should be customer-focused and demand-driven, rather than supply-push schemes advocating the use of specific technologies. (2) Technology diffusion programmes should have broad targets and cover different types of technologies, firms and sectors. (3) Technology diffusion programmes should provide a range of services to address the many requirements for successful technology acquisition and use. (4) Technology diffusion programmes should be integrated and build on inter-relationships in national innovation systems. (5) Technology diffusion programmes should include soft as well as hard technologies and address the managerial and organisational changes needed to adapt to technical change. (6) Technology diffusion programmes should have stability and a long-term perspective and incorporate feedback from on-going evaluations and assessments.	technology diffusion programmes *** new technologies *** firms and sectors *** job creation *** technology diffusion programmes *** systemic failures *** technology diffusion programmes *** innovation performance *** technology diffusion *** business sector *** best practices *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems *** technology diffusion *** technology transfer *** technology diffusion programmes *** firms and sectors *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion programmes *** national innovation systems *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)1	WORKSHOP ON TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION: RAPPORTEUR'S REPORT	1997	W2	OECD governments maintain a variety of technology diffusion initiatives to aid firms in identifying, absorbing and implementing technology and know-how. Programmes to diffuse technology are intended largely to address market and systemic failures. Firms may lack information about technologies or face disadvantages due to scale requirements or high learning costs, resulting in underinvestment in new technology. At the system-level, failures may arise from weaknesses in linkages and interactions among different actors in the national innovation system. In addition, part of the rationale for public support to technology diffusion lies in maximising returns from public investment in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and technology development programmes. Other economic goals such as competitiveness, regional economic development and job creation are also reasons for government initiatives to disseminate technology. Four types of technology diffusion programmes, categorised here by operational focus, were discussed at the workshop: 1) supply-driven, 2) demand-driven, 3) network-based and 4)infrastructure-building. Supply-side initiatives are essentially programmes to transfer and commercialise technology from government research programmes to private enterprise; they are targeted to lower-technology industries as well as high-technology sectors. Demand-driven programmes generally start with the firm and aim to identify the technology gaps, needs and opportunities facing enterprises, especially smaller businesses; increasingly they attempt to diagnose and enhance the technological absorptive capacity of firms. Network-building initiatives, many of which operate at the regional level, aim to develop and enhance the role of bridging institutions and inter-firm partnerships in promoting information flows and the diffusion of technology. A fourth category of initiatives are those that work from a system-wide perspective to upgrade the technology diffusion infrastructure at the national level. Overall, different countries pursue a varying mix of technology diffusion programmes which reflect not only their national systems of innovation but also specific regional and broader economic dynamics. The workshop identified a number of trends in OECD technology diffusion programmes which also reflect emerging agreement on best practices at a general level: (1) Ensuring quality control. Technology diffusion programmes should take steps to ensure the quality of service providers, the appropriate training of consultants and the effectiveness of local delivery systems. (2) Focusing on customers. Technology diffusion programmes should start with a focus on customers and users and aim at meeting the changing technical needs of companies. (3) Upgrading the innovative capacity of firms. Technology diffusion programmes should promote a general awareness of the value of innovation among management and stimulate demand for technical and organisational change within firms. (4) Integrating with national innovation systems. Technology diffusion programmes should build on existing inter-relationships in national innovation systems and have greater coherence between programme design (e.g. targets, objectives, modes of support) and service delivery. (5) Building in evaluation and assessment. Technology diffusion programmes should have mechanisms for assessment which can guide and improve their operation and management on a continuing basis.	technology diffusion *** systemic failures *** technology diffusion *** new technologies *** national innovation systems *** public investment in research *** technology diffusion *** technology development *** development programmes *** job creation *** technology diffusion programmes *** research programmes *** technology diffusion *** regional level *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion programmes *** best practices *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion programmes *** innovation capacity *** technology diffusion programmes *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)10	REQUEST FOR DATA AND INFORMATION ON Research and Development INCENTIVES	1997	S	Financial support to industrial Research and Development is one of the areas of government support to innovation and technology diffusion that is currently being examined in the context of the Project on Technology, Productivity and Job Creation (TPJ) -- Phase II. One objective is to estimate the impact of these incentives on Research and Development investment, including the efficacy of design features such as incrementality. Data and information needed deal with: (1) Corporate income tax rate; (2) Tax treatment of the cost of Research and Development (Were current expenses fully deductible in the year incurred over the period 1980-96? Was machinery and equipment allowed an immediate write-off in the period 1990-96?  Was buildings used for Research and Development allowed an immediate write-off in the time period selected?) (3) Research and Development tax incentives: Was your credit incremental, level-based, or both?  What  was  the percentage rate of  the credit? What costs did it apply to? Current (salaries, other), machinery, buildings (please check if appropriate)? Was it refundable or not (in tax years when firms post losses)? Were there significant changes in the definition of Research and Development? Were chabadu chabados granted a preferential  treatment?   If yes specify and give  the  percentage of Research and Development investment performed by chabadu chabados in relevant years; If credit was incremental, how was the increment calculated? Over the period 1980-96, had you more than one tax credit in effect (for example, one level-based, and another incremental)?

DSTI/STP/TIP(97)11	QUESTIONNAIRE ON GOOD PRACTICES IN TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION	1997	S	The objective is to broaden and deepen the analyses of national technology diffusion programmes/initiatives and identify good or effective practices in technology diffusion  policies.  This  work will build on the typology shown in Table 8.1 of the Interim Report: Technology, Productivity, and Job Creation: Towards Best Policy Practice [C/MIN (97)7/ADD2]. The results from the questionnaire should help identify those areas where governments are placing most of their diffusion efforts at the national level (e.g. on advisory services for small manufacturing or service firms, etc.) as well as the  factors for the success or failure of these initiatives which can be translated into effective or good practices for such programmes/initiatives. This survey should also help provide an indication of emerging trends in technology diffusion programmes/initiatives.The typology identifies 3 goals and associates programme types to each. Level 1: improve the adoption and adaptations of specific technologies (programmes can be technology specific; institution specific, sector specific or demonstration). Level 2: improve the general technology receptor capacity of firms (through technical assistance, information networks or assistance for small-scale Research and Development projects). Level 3: build the innovative capacity of firms (through sector-wide technology roadmaps, diagnostic tools, benchmarking, university-industry collaboration).	technology diffusion programmes *** job creation *** good practices *** technology diffusion programmes *** innovation capacity *** good practices *** technology diffusion	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)12/REV1	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND INNOVATION: ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK	1997	R	1. Innovation is key to achieving sustainable development, but the environment/innovation nexus is poorly understood. Moreover, there has been little interaction between the realms of technology policy and environmental policy in most OECD capitals. This paper proposes an analytical framework for understanding the effects of environmental policies on innovation in industry. 2. Environmental policy instruments differ in their effects on innovation. Product standards tend prompt incremental innovation or modifications at the margin. Product bans, in contrast, stimulate radical innovation in the form of replacements, but also entail disruptions and costs. Performance standards for industrial processes are technically flexible, while technology specifications tend to be backward rather than forward-looking but can stimulate technology diffusion. Economic instruments,  such as pollution charges and tradable permits, have had only mild innovation effects, largely because they are not set at high levels or used extensively. Nor have voluntary agreements brought much pressure for technological change, although newer forms of environmental compacts may hold more promise. Also valuable are approaches such as producer responsibility, information disclosure and environmental management systems, which can encourage the complete redesign of products and processes . 3. Certain policy reforms could promote more environmental innovation. The flexibility of command-and-control instruments could be enhanced by shifting away from technology specifications, modernising monitoring systems, and encouraging alternative compliance methods. Product regulation should promote product stewardship and producer responsibility and reduce the bias against new, innovative products. The potential of voluntary agreements, information disclosure and corporate management systems needs to be further explored. Environmental policy instruments may best stimulate innovation when they are used in combination (e.g. performance standards and information disclosure) and take into account the industry-specific and even firm-specific context. This will require an improved merger of environmental policy and technology policy and better co-ordination among environmental and technology agencies.	sustainable development *** environmental policy *** industrial innovation *** environmental policy *** environmental policy *** policy instruments *** technology diffusion *** economic instruments *** technological change *** environmental innovations *** innovative products *** environmental policy *** policy instruments *** environmental policy *** environmental policy	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** other_policy_areas *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)13	AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: VARIOUS APPROACHES AND EARLY FINDINGS	1997	R	1. Findings regarding specialisation patterns and interlinkages in national innovation systems (NIS) can be analysed with a view to answering three questions: (1) Can country systemic differences be depicted at an aggregate level? (2) What are country similarities and differences in their science and technology specialisation patterns? (3) How far do countries differ in the density and forms of linkages and interactions within their respective NIS? The main findings can be summarised as follows: 2. There is a co-existence of convergence at the macro-level and increasing technological specialisation at the meso- and micro-level which is a reflection of both a deepening of the division of labour between countries and different historically-grown institutional settings which determine country-specific paths of development and innovation climates. This is not in contradiction with the rapid internationalisation of economic and technological activities but rather confirms that globalisation does  not only facilitate the diffusion of best production practices and increase the scope of innovation networks but also magnifies the impact of some nation-specific factors of innovation-based competitiveness. 3. The number of countries that show strong similarities in their respective scientific and technological specialisation patterns is limited, and there are no overall signs of convergence of specialisation patterns, except in a yet small impact of regional integration in Europe. For most of the countries, there is a significant positive correlation between their past and present specialisation patterns, an indication that technological capabilities are accumulated over time and that development is strongly path-dependent. 4. Networks of innovation are the rule, not the exception, and most innovative activity involves multiple actors. Although networking seems to be a common attribute of innovation irrespective of country size, there are also some marked country differences - with respect both to domestic and international innovation links and knowledge flows. 5. Structural linkages among national innovation systems are building rapidly and diversifying to encompass all forms of knowledge flows. This is reflected in an increased share of technology acquired from abroad in capital and intermediary goods, in the growth of purchases of foreign patents and licenses, in a rapidly increasing number of strategic technological business alliances between firms of different countries and, in science, in a growing number of internationally co-authored publications. But the respective importance of foreign and domestic flows of knowledge differs considerably between countries. Generally, the importance of external sources of knowledge declines with distance, even in the age of globalised communication networks. 6. The national research and technological infrastructure remains of paramount importance for innovative firms in most countries. It is in this respect that national innovation systems differ most. Even in smaller countries with considerable inflows of imported technology, the national research infrastructure, the adoption capabilities of the firms, the labour relations and the framework conditions more or less conducive to innovative behaviour are still determined predominantly at the national level.	national innovation systems *** specialisation patterns *** specialisation patterns *** specialisation patterns *** specialisation patterns *** innovation activities *** knowledge flows *** knowledge flows *** national innovation systems *** knowledge flows *** innovative firms *** national innovation systems *** framework conditions *** national innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)14/FINAL	FACILITATING INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CO-OPERATION: PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEOUL CONFERENCE	1997	W2	Rapporteur summary. Globalisation in the knowledge-based economy implies an ever-expanding international flow of technology, scientific knowledge and know-how. The OECD Conference on International Technology Co-operation devoted two days to a consideration of a wide range of issues related to this topic, focusing on the globalisation of research and development, the role of intellectual property rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT) in facilitating or impeding international technology co-operation and the role of governments in facilitating  or impeding such co-operation. Both the presentations and general discussion at the conference took the view that international flows of technology and knowledge were both inevitable and desirable, supporting economic growth in nations throughout the global economy and contributing to the development of industrialising economies in Asia and elsewhere. Expanding international flows of technology and knowledge are closely connected to larger trends in the globalisation of other economic activities, such as markets for goods and services and production networks. But the unusual nature of knowledge as an economic good, as well as its central importance in the future development of a global knowledge-based economy, raise special issues that require attention. Although they covered a diverse set of issues, the presentations and comments of the experts gathered in Seoul addressed common themes. Even in a global economy without borders, government policies continue to be influential, especially in affecting international knowledge flows and technology co-operation. But the aims and effects of government policies now can be either intensified or frustrated  by the actions of private firms. In addition, the formulation and implementation of the innovation policies of national governments in economies that are linked more closely by cross-border flows of technology, knowledge, goods and capital confronts a fundamental tension between the need of democratically elected governments to be accountable to national citizens for the operation and economic benefits of such programmes, and the growing reliance by national firms on foreign partners, foreign markets and foreign suppliers. Indeed, even the most basic question  what is a national firm?  has become very difficult to answer in many cases. Moreover, just as the increased integration of capital markets has  limited  the  ability of many OECD governments to pursue sharply divergent economic policies, the development of a truly global innovation system appears to be intensifying pressure for harmonization in government policies toward intellectual property, regulatory, tax, research and development, and many other policies. But international demands for such harmonization also contribute to tensions between national autonomy and the achievement of high levels of economic performance. Finally, although the conferences title and this summary report discussed globalisation as a general phenomenon, its important economic effects,   as well as the effects of many government policies on international technology co-operation, exhibit significant differences among industries. One makes sweeping statements about industry-wide trends at ones peril. Conclusion International technological co-operation is indispensable to economic growth and improvement in the   lives of billions of citizens in the industrialised and developing economies. OECD Member countries, and the OECD itself, have a responsibility to develop policies that will support this trend.  But  the  development and implementation of such policies by democratic governments also requires policies to support adjustment and prevent the losers from globalisation from obstructing liberalisation.  In  pursuing these goals, it also is important to recognise that globalisation of the innovation process is proceeding at a very different pace among individual OECD Member countries. The speed and current level of internationalisation of their Research and Development operations vary considerably among individual manufacturing industries. Although public policies will be applied to all industries, assessments of current and future trends must recognise the significant differences among individual industries and technological areas. The discussions at the Seoul conference also put to rest any notion that governments no longer matter in the face of globalisation in economic and innovative activities. Government policies of investment in national Research and Development infrastructure and human capital are essential to the attraction of international flows of   Research and Development and related high value-added activities. Among other advantages, the fruits of such investments are somewhat less internationally mobile than are the results of technology development programmes supported by public funds  indeed, regional agglomerations of technological expertise are surprisingly enduring. By focusing on the less mobile assets as targets for their investments, governments may be able to avoid some of the political tensions that arise from the clash between national political goals in an internationally interdependent economy and innovation system. But investment in Research and Development infrastructure alone is an insufficient prescription  the structure of national Research and Development infrastructure also must be reformed, to place greater emphasis on institutional autonomy, competition for scientific  talent,  and  peer  review  of  research  proposals  and  performance.  As  Mr. Leitterstorf  and  Mr. Beyer both remarked, a useful indicator of the quality of national university systems is their ability to attract foreign students seeking a top-flight graduate education. In this area, as in others, the pressure of international competition appears to be triggering efforts in a number of OECD economies to undertake such reforms. But government policies must maintain a balance between support for the creation of new technologies and support for their rapid and efficient adoption. The latter goal in particular is best served  by a policy of openness to foreign investment in manufacturing, services, Research and Development, and a relatively non-restrictive policy toward foreign firms participation in public Research and Development programmes.  It may also require  a more nuanced approach to the development of domestic intellectual property rights policies, as well as co-ordination between policies in INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT and in other spheres, such as competition policy. The interests of chabadu chabados in particular are likely to be best served by such a balanced and co-ordinated approach to policy formulation. Governments thus still matter a great deal. But the effects of many government policies now are mediated to a greater extent by the actions of private firms, especially MNEs with operations throughout the industrial and industrialising world. In the area of technology policy, governments rely  on  such  enterprises to make the investments that translate public Research and Development and related investments into employment opportunities and economic growth. Moreover, the contrasting structure of the innovation systems of  many OECD Member countries reflects the legacy of private firms investment and operating decisions in previous decades. The remarkable post-war history and economic development of South Korea illustrate another aspect of   the role of government in economic development and globalisation. Economic development in  the post-war South Korean economy benefited from government policies that initially combined support for inward technology transfer, restrictions on imports and foreign direct investment, policies  to  ensure intense competition among domestic firms, and policies to encourage entry by domestic firms into international markets. Throughout this period, government policy focused on supporting the  inward transfer and adoption of new technologies.  One of the most remarkable features of government policy   was its adaptation to changing economic circumstances  as South Korea has shifted from reverse engineering and imitation of foreign technological innovations to a position of operating at the technological frontier in many industries, South Korean government policy has shifted to address new challenges and opportunities. In the economic sphere, government policies have adapted to  support stronger INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, more support for fundamental research, and greater openness to imports and foreign investment. Many of these new policies have come about in response to direct pressure from other governments as a result of South Koreas growing economic power, while others reflect change in the domestic political environment. The potential for a strong promotional role of government is effectively illustrated by the South Korean experience, as is the need for extraordinary flexibility and adaptation on the part of government.  The  future role of government in South Koreas economic development is unclear, but it is likely to involve  less direct intervention, more deregulation, the development of a stronger domestic competition policy,   and a continued responsibility for supporting the Research and Development infrastructure. The Seoul conference produced several ideas regarding future research needs. The participants of the Conference emphasized the need to improve the collection of data on internationalisation of Research and Development and to analyse the impact of the globalisation of industrial research on innovation potential and technological policy in OECD countries.  The extension of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT protection is another important issue.  Much remains to  be done to improve consistency of policies, standards, and enforcement within the OECD, to say nothing  of the challenges associated with extending this INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT regime to cover more of the global economy. At the same time, however, additional research is needed on the economic effects of stronger protection of  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT and on the effects of efforts to extend the areas covered by INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT into those formerly classified as fundamental research, in contrast to technology development (see David and Foray, 1997, for a critical discussion of these issues). The Seoul conference vividly illustrated the close linkages between technology policy issues and trade policy issues in both the domestic and international political arenas. These closer links reflect the substantive connection between these areas that results from increased economic and technological integration among the OECD Member countries, as well as the fact that the dominant channel for multilateral negotiation and enforcement of meaningful agreements in many areas relevant to the issues debated in Seoul is trade policy. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT issues obviously are directly implicated in trade policy, but they also will be linked more closely to future multilateral negotiations over competition policy. Issues of access to public Research and Development programmes involve issues of subsidies, trade-related investment measures, and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, to name only a few. The Seoul conference devoted too little attention to another important concern  how are the fruits of  closer economic and technological integration within the OECD to be conveyed to the numerous nations and far more numerous individuals who are not part of this network at present? The earlier discussion of Research and Development globalisation, and most studies of direct foreign investment, note that these flows are largely concentrated among the Triad economies and a few favoured destinations in East Asia. Private direct investment flows are critically important channels for the international transfer of technology, advanced manufacturing and management policies, and a host of other capabilities that are essential for  the  economic improvement of the worlds citizens. The issues covered in the Seoul conference have emerged as by-products of the remarkable success of post-1945 multilateral political and economic policy. The liberalisation of the global trading and  investment system benefited both the industrial and many developing nations. OECD Member countries now face challenges in maintaining and extending such liberalisation in an international political environment that differs from the environment in which these policies took root. The issues discussed in Seoul are minor impediments at worst to continued liberalisation, and support for removing such obstacles to international technological co-operation appears to be strong. An even greater challenge, however,  is  the need to spread the benefits of such liberalisation more widely in the future. This will tax the ingenuity of policy makers in OECD and other governments well into the next century.	knowledge-based economy *** intellectual property *** globalisation of research *** international technology co-operation *** technological knowledge *** global economy *** economic growth *** technological knowledge *** knowledge-based economy *** knowledge flows *** global economy *** technology co-operation *** private firms *** policy implementation *** intellectual property *** innovation systems *** international technology co-operation *** international technology co-operation *** economic growth *** innovation process *** innovation activities *** development programmes *** technology development *** innovation systems *** research investments *** new technologies *** foreign firms *** development programmes *** public research and development *** foreign direct investment *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** policy formulation *** small and medium sized firms *** private firms *** public research and development *** economic growth *** private firms *** innovation systems *** foreign direct investment *** technology transfer *** new technologies *** intellectual property *** fundamental research *** foreign direct investment *** competition policy *** internationalisation of research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** global economy *** intellectual property *** fundamental research *** technology development *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** development programmes *** intellectual property *** public research and development *** foreign direct investment *** technology transfer *** international technology co-operation *** international technology co-operation	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** other_policy_areas *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)15/REV1	INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE Research and Development AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS	1997	R	1. Participation in international collaborative research and development projects is driven by the economic advantages to be derived from the activity; the main results of such projects are in the form of knowledge, patents, designs and other forms of intellectual property. Successful research collaboration at the global level depends partly upon the establishment of frameworks of rights to intellectual property, in all its types and uses. However, many national intellectual property systems exist, each of which presents its own compromise between the rights of innovators to derive value from their activities and the rights of society to benefit from the rapid development and diffusion of new technologies. There has been significant progress in harmonisation through the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and through the European Patent Convention (EPC) in European countries. Further harmonisation should result from the Patent Law Treaty now being discussed in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). 2. Still, some national differences remain which can lead to uncertainties and difficulties for international collaborative research activities. Certain of these issues stem from the design and nature of the intellectual property rights regimes themselves, particularly as related to patents. In addition to basic differences concerning filing rules (first-to-file or first-to-invent), other divergences in national INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT approaches can pose problems for international collaborative research. There may be differences in the rules regarding assignment of patent rights and whether these accrue to individual researchers and inventors or to the institutions which employ them. Rules regarding the disclosure of information, particularly when parties are from countries with grace periods, and protection of confidential information tend to complicate joint research, especially that which involves industry-university collaboration. In addition, participation in international joint research can be discouraged at the outset by the high costs of patenting at the international level. These factors can also influence the choice of location for the conduct of international joint research activities. 3. Other issues pertain to more general legal and regulatory regimes that affect the design, location and exploitation of the results of international collaborative research projects. This is due to the fact that these projects pull together partners that operate under different national and institutional settings. Relevant conditions include competition policies, which differ in their treatment of research and development joint ventures and patent pools; tax regimes, which may lead to diverging levels of benefits for different parties to the research; and contract laws, which vary in their recognition of the entities and individuals empowered to commit resources such as previous patents and intellectual property. In summary, international collaborative research is a complex undertaking and the further uncertainties created by diverging intellectual property regimes and related policies may discourage such ventures and call for further international harmonisation.	intellectual property *** collaborative research and development *** international collaborative research *** intellectual property *** collaborative research *** intellectual property *** development and diffusion *** new technologies *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** patent law *** research activities *** international collaborative research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** international collaborative research *** intellectual property *** international level *** research activities *** international collaborative research *** joint ventures *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** intellectual property *** international collaborative research *** intellectual property *** collaborative research and development *** international collaborative research	policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation

DSTI/STP/TIP(97)17	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS:  PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE WORK	1997	S	The following are proposals   for future TIP work on intellectual property rights issues, which Delegates are asked to discuss and prioritise; other proposals for work are also welcome. It is envisioned that only one topic  can  be undertaken for in-depth analysis in 1998. Proposal A:  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT Principles for International Collaborative Research and Development This work would further the analysis undertaken in the study of International Collaborative   Research and Development and Intellectual Property Rights (OECD, 1997a) with a view to developing a set of principles for intellectual property frameworks for joint international research. All international innovative  activities,  and collaborative research in particular, are affected by the differences among national INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT regimes relating to filing rules, disclosure rules, examination of applications, scope of third party rights, protection of confidential information, enforcement prospects, procedures for challenge, etc. The formulation of general agreed-upon principles could help provide an overall intellectual property rights framework for collaborative Research and Development undertakings. Proposal B:  Intellectual Property and Commercialisation of Research, particularly research sponsored or funded by government agencies. There is at present great variety in the manner in which governments treat intellectual property arising from publicly-supported research in universities and government laboratories and research institutes. Some countries grant the university or institution the option to claim intellectual property rights and to commercialise or license the research results. In other countries, the funding agency may keep the option for development and commercialisation. In still other countries or situations, the individual or inventor may have the title to   the intellectual property rights stemming from research. Proposal C:  Industrial Strategies in Intellectual Property Rights. This work would analyse trends in industrial strategies relating to intellectual property rights, particularly at the international level, in order to identify important issues to be taken into account in the design of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT regimes.  Proposal D:  Intellectual Property Rights and Small Firms This work would generally assess the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT-related problems confronted by smaller firms and outline policy implications and possible solutions. It would be carried out in  co-operation  with  the Industry Committee Working Party on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. Proposal E:  Intellectual Property, Competition Policy and Innovation. This analysis would focus on the potential conflict between competition policy and intellectual property rights, with a view to identifying the implications for innovation at both the national and international levels. Antitrust concerns have been expressed with regard to collaborative research and development at the national and international levels, pooling and cross-licensing of patents, horizontal mergers and acquisitions in technology markets and certain standard-setting activities, all of which may have anti-competition effects in supporting monopolistic or oligopolistic tendencies. Proposal F:  Facilitating International Examination of Patents. Demands have been expressed for closer co-ordination of patent examinations at the international level through methods such as promoting the use of a common database, establishment of patent examination standards, exchange of patent examiners between countries and mutual recognition of search results and patent findings. This analysis would examine the cost and competitiveness effects of current patent examination approaches to illuminate the actual difficulties and burdens placed on industry. It would also assess the feasibility and practicality of the various approaches for improving co-ordination, including some type of mutual recognition mechanism.	intellectual property *** intellectual property *** international collaborative research *** collaborative research and development *** intellectual property *** collaborative research *** intellectual property *** collaborative research and development *** commercialisation of research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** research results *** intellectual property *** funding agencies *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** international level *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** intellectual property *** competition policy *** international level *** technology markets *** collaborative research and development *** international level *** international level *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** other_policy_areas *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)2	NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: BACKGROUND REPORT	1996	R	1. The national innovation systems approach stresses that the flows of technology and information among people and institutions are key to the innovative process. Innovation and technology development are the result of a complex set of relationships among actors in the system, which includes enterprises, universities and government research institutes. For policy-makers, an understanding of the national innovation system can help identify leverage points for enhancing innovative performance and overall competitiveness. It can assist in pinpointing mismatches within the system, both among institutions and in relation to government policies, which can thwart technology development and innovation. Policies which seek to improve networking among the actors and institutions in the system and which aim at enhancing the innovative capacity of firms, particularly their ability to identify and absorb technologies, are most valuable in this context. 2. The measurement and assessment of national innovation systems has centred on four types of knowledge or information flows: 1) interactions among enterprises, primarily joint research activities and other technical collaborations; 2) interactions among enterprises, universities and public research institutes,  including  joint  research,  co-patenting,  co-publications  and  more  informal  linkages; 3) technology diffusion, including industry adoption rates for new technologies and diffusion through machinery and equipment; and 4) personnel mobility, focusing on the movement of technical personnel within and between the public and private sectors. Attempts to link these flows to firm performance show that high levels of technical collaboration, technology diffusion and personnel mobility contribute to the improved innovative capacity of enterprises in terms of products, patents and productivity. 3. There are many different approaches to analysing national innovation systems. Firm-level innovation surveys question enterprises on their sources of knowledge most relevant to innovation and allow a ranking of different linkages by industrial sector and country. Cluster analysis focuses on the interactions between particular types of firms and sectors, which can be grouped according to their technological and networking characteristics. Patterns of knowledge flows can differ markedly from cluster to cluster and also within countries specialised around different industrial clusters (e.g. forestry, chemicals). Innovation systems can also be analysed at different levels: sub-regional, national, pan-regional and international. While the national level may be the most relevant due to the role of country-specific interactions in creating a climate for innovation, international technology flows and collaborations are taking on growing significance. 4. Future research will focus on improving the indicators used to map interactions in national innovation systems as well as the linkages to the innovative performance of firms and countries. These indicators are at an early stage of development and do not approach the robustness of more conventional measures such as Research and Development expenditures. A main goal is to improve the comparability of studies across countries by encouraging those engaging in analysis of innovation systems to focus first on measuring a core set of knowledge flows using similar indicators. At the same time, specific analyses will be directed to deepening the understanding of certain types of flows in national innovation systems, namely: 1) human resource flows, 2) institutional linkages, 3) industrial clusters and 4) innovative firm behaviour.	national innovation systems *** information technology *** technology development *** research organisations *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** technology development *** innovation capacity *** research activities *** private sector *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems *** new technologies *** research organisations *** personnel mobility *** technology diffusion *** innovation capacity *** personnel mobility *** national innovation systems *** firms and sectors *** knowledge flows *** innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** research and development expenditures *** knowledge flows *** innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** human resources *** national innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_human_resources *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)3	ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMMES: BACKGROUND REPORT	1997	R	46. Despite the evaluations of their benefits in terms of advancing research, fostering innovative networks and contributing to industrial competitiveness, OECD advanced technology programmes have not escaped controversy regarding the appropriateness of government funding to for-profit companies and for pre-competitive research rather than basic scientific research. These characteristics distinguish advanced technology programmes from the significant government funding given to research in national laboratories and universities. They have led to criticisms that, through advanced technology programmes, governments are getting too involved in picking industrial winners and losers. Most agree that government funding programmes should remove themselves as much as possible from the commercialisation end of the innovation spectrum and concentrate on what is termed basic technology research. Programmes that fund research which is more near-market may become politically vulnerable. In addition, evaluations of programmes such as EUREKA show that government funding is often not needed for later-stage projects, which benefit more from initiatives to link researchers and entities with similar or complementary technical knowledge. 47. Evaluations to date have not dispelled all doubts or criticisms levelled at advanced technology programmes. Most of the evaluations cited in this report have been conducted by the sponsoring agencies themselves or through surveys of participating firms, which renders their conclusions less than totally objective. Aside from these assessments, there have been complaints regarding the implementation and cost-effectiveness of advanced technology programmes, particularly insufficient oversight and a lack of incentive to reduce costs. Some believe they attract only second-level research projects and less-qualified research teams. Others maintain these programmes encourage the initiation of research efforts at the expense of more valuable, longer-term efforts by industry. There are continuing questions as to whether the projects would have been funded in the absence of government financing. Scant evidence has been collected as to the commercial outcomes of the research. And it appears that little attention has been given to encouraging spin-offs from funded Research and Development projects and to technology diffusion. 48. In contrast, it is agreed that one of the main advantages of advanced technology programmes lies in their leverage effects in calling forth private funding and directing it towards high-risk, high- potential technical areas. Almost all programmes multiply their effectiveness through matching fund requirements as well as by promoting competition among applicants for funding. Cost-sharing by government and industry, although taking different forms, seems to encourage effective participation by the private sector in PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. Industry has in most countries expressed its preference for cost-shared arrangements over purely government-financed projects, and there is a growing trend towards such partnerships in overall government Research and Development funding. 49. Another general benefit of advanced technology programmes is their promotion of joint research consortia. These programmes tend to bring together disparate groups to pursue common technology development opportunities through the establishment of horizontal consortia, vertical producer-supplier relationships and linkages between large and small companies. Evaluations in both Europe and the United States show that some companies which came together to apply for advanced technology awards continued to conduct joint research  even if they didnt win the awards.  Often the   process by which they mounted a proposal persuaded them of the value of the collaborative research in question sufficiently to initiate the joint work on their own. Advanced technology programmes have also fostered new linkages between firms, research institutes and universities. They have stimulated a new way of approaching research for many enterprises and laboratories, who have come to realise the innovative benefits of multiple research partners. 50. Given their potential value, a co-operative attempt is needed to identify best practices in advanced technology programmes in OECD countries in order to maximise their contributions to technology development and economic growth. The following are the main issues for discussion with regard to the design of advanced technology programmes: Research focus -- Advanced technology programmes tend to be directed to pre-competitive projects of broad potential value, but commercial and economic effects are hard to identify and their role in filling research gaps continues to be questioned. Teaming arrangements -- Advanced technology programmes which give preference to consortia of firms and/or universities and research institutes, over those funding single companies, may yield more research synergies and improve linkages in national innovation systems. Technical fields -- While the specification of technical areas for research can help focus efforts and increase government leverage in specific fields, an open call for proposals may promote more wide-ranging innovation and reduce the chance for error in identifying important avenues for research. Selection and funding -- Greater leverage effects appear to be obtained from programmes which make awards on the basis of peer review of technical and economic factors in competitive processes and require cost-sharing on the part of participants. Partnership paradigm -- While PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in technology development can have numerous direct and indirect benefits, the relative advantages and disadvantages of alternative configurations and funding arrangements may need to be further explored. Technology diffusion -- Technological spin-offs from advanced technology programmes are one of the main goals, so greater attention might be given to means for more broadly disseminating the results of the Research and Development conducted. Evaluation -- While surveys of participating firms can yield insights into the effects of advanced technology programmes, longer-term and independent assessments may provide a sounder basis for improving their design and implementation	scientific research *** technology programmes *** technology programmes *** technology programmes *** funded research *** technology programmes *** technology programmes *** funded research *** technology diffusion *** technology programmes *** public private partnerships *** private sector *** technology programmes *** technology development *** collaborative research *** research organisations *** technology programmes *** technology development *** economic growth *** best practices *** technology programmes *** technology programmes *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** technology programmes *** peer review *** technology development *** public private partnerships *** research results *** technology diffusion *** technology programmes *** technology programmes *** technology programmes	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)4	TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS: BACKGROUND REPORT	1997	R	1. A business incubator provides facilities and services to support the creation of independent start-up firms. In addition to below market rents and shared office services, incubators provide managerial, technical, legal and financial services. Three main types of business incubators can be identified: a) general/mixed use incubators, b) economic development incubators and c) technology incubators. The objectives of business incubators differ according to the stakeholders involved; for example, local economic development agencies seek to create jobs while universities may seek to promote technology transfer and diffusion. 2. Since the 1980s, technology incubators have become an important tool of technology and innovation policies in OECD countries. Technology incubators act as bridging institutions between entrepreneurs, universities, industry and sources of capital. Unlike general business incubators, however, technology incubators are generally not stand-alone operations and tend be located at or near sources of higher education, public research institutes and clusters of firms with Research and Development capacity. However, the concept of technology incubation differs from one country to another, and incubators may be distinct entities within universities and science parks or be part of innovation centres. In some countries, the focus of technology incubators is on attracting existing firms with Research and Development capacity or subsidiaries of larger knowledge-based firms, while in others the stress is on promoting entrepreneurs. 3. Technology incubators provide a range of services, including physical infrastructure (office space, laboratories), management support (business planning, training, marketing), technical support (researchers, data bases), access to financing (venture capital funds, business angel networks), legal assistance (licensing, intellectual property) and networking (other incubators, government services). Technology incubators are themselves a type of business and require effective managers as well as advisory boards (made up of public/private stakeholders) which guide and advise firms and provide links to investors. The relative success of incubators has been shown to depend largely on the role of the incubator manager, the role of the advisory board and the availability of venture financing. 4. Evaluations of the impact of business incubators have tended to be positive in terms of the survival rates of firms; however, evidence regarding job growth and firm creation is mixed. Technology incubators are a recent development and, while some technology incubators have produced successful firms and created skilled jobs, their broader economic and innovative impact may only be realised over the longer-term. The cost-effectiveness of technology incubators and the returns to government investments have not been fully assessed. This paper discusses areas for identifying best practices in the development and design of technology incubators, including their relationship to the local innovative infrastructure, their role in enhancing the innovative capacity of tenant firms, their responsibilities to investors, and the assessment and evaluation of technology incubator programmes in order to improve their cost- effectiveness and value-added to firms.	business incubators *** business incubators *** technology incubators *** business incubators *** technology transfer *** technology incubators *** technology incubators *** business incubators *** higher education *** research organisations *** technology incubators *** technology incubators *** venture capital *** business angels *** intellectual property *** technology incubators *** technology incubators *** business incubators *** technology incubators *** technology incubators *** innovation capacity *** best practices *** technology incubators *** technology incubators	policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)4/REV1	TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS: NURTURING SMALL FIRMS	1997	W2	Since the 1980s, technology incubators have become an important policy tool in OECD and non-Member countries for helping new technology-based firms increase their chances of survival and generate wealth and jobs. Technology incubators are a specific type of business incubator: property-based ventures which provide a range of services to entrepreneurs and start-ups, including physical infrastructure (office space, laboratories), management support (business planning, training, marketing), technical support (researchers, data bases), access to financing (venture capital funds, business angel networks), legal assistance (licensing, intellectual property) and networking (with other incubators and government services). The rationale for public support of technology incubators lies in market and systemic failures which limit the ability of small, innovative firms to survive during the early stages and of entrepreneurs to overcome the uncertainty and obstacles associated with firm start-ups. Support by OECD governments is generally provided at the local and regional levels, but central governments may also play a direct and indirect role. It is recognised that entrepreneurs face numerous challenges in starting a business, including substantial entry costs, high-fixed costs, lack of access to equity capital, insufficient technical and market information, and weak management skills. The start-up phase of a small business is associated with considerable uncertainty, and new businesses often have cash flow problems during this period. Support for business incubators is also provided on the basis of (regional) economic development objectives: stimulating job creation and industrial restructuring. Technology incubators have four main objectives: 1) economic development; 2) technology commercialisation; 3) property venture/real estate development; and 4) entrepreneurship. Job creation is a main underlying purpose of incubator support for new business formation, especially of technology-based firms. Incubators can also play an important role in strengthening co-operation between public and private actors in regional economic development. They have an outreach role, fostering entrepreneurship and training in the local community. Moreover, incubators have a symbolic role in that they allow governments to demonstrate their efforts to address problems of regional development and unemployment. Evaluations of the effects of technology incubators on firm survival rates tend to be positive, but evidence regarding their impacts on job growth and net firm creation is mixed. Because technology incubators are a recent development, their broader economic and innovative impacts may only be realised over the longer-term. Good practices with regard to technology incubators have been identified at the overall policy level and the level of the incubator. Above all, there is a need for incubators to avoid sole reliance on subsidies and to diversify sources of financing. While leveraging existing services and tailoring them to client needs is important, incubators should not overemphasise these functions to the detriment of building linkages and networking with industry and especially investors. Technology incubators can be lucrative property-based ventures, underlining the need to balance short-term prerogatives (i.e. high occupancy rates) and longer-term goals (e.g. technology commercialisation). Sharing experiences among incubators and improving systems of evaluation are also important practices.	technology based firms *** policy profiles *** new technologies *** technology incubators *** venture capital *** business angels *** intellectual property *** business incubators *** technology incubators *** systemic failures *** innovative firms *** technology incubators *** regional level *** job creation *** business incubators *** technology commercialisation *** technology incubators *** job creation *** technology based firms *** technology incubators *** technology incubators *** good practices *** technology incubators *** technology incubators *** technology commercialisation *** evaluation systems *** small and medium sized firms *** technology incubators	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)5	PROGRESS OF THE SECOND PHASE OF WORK ON NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS	1997	M	In the second phase of OECD analysis of national innovation systems, work will proceed along two tracks: 1) broad comparative analysis of national innovation systems by the Secretariat, and 2) more in-depth analysis of specific aspects within focus groups. In the recent publication on national innovation systems (OECD, 1997), a list of common core indicators was presented to be developed by countries both for their own analysis as well as for the comparative work to be carried out by the Secretariat. More in-depth analysis will be carried out by specific focus groups : Focus group on innovative firms (with special attention to intangibles and organisational characteristics, Access to external knowledge and firms networks) ; Focus group on industrial clusters (key questions: To what  extent do clusters differ in their innovation performance, mechanisms of knowledge transfer and distribution power? What role do clusters play in shaping the pattern of specialisation of a NIS? Which policy recommendations can be derived from a cluster approach to technology and innovation policy?) ; Focus group on human resources (attentive to personnel mobility) ; Focus group on catching-up economies (different models; the need to build up an indigenous science and technology base) ; Focus Group on institutional mapping (with both quantitative and qualitative measures, using a model for mapping institutions in all countries)	national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** innovation performance *** innovative firms *** knowledge transfer *** human resources *** personnel mobility *** national innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)6	GLOBALISATION OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH: BACKGROUND REPORT	1997	R	1. The globalisation of industrial research is increasing in the 1990s as more multinational enterprises invest in new research facilities abroad and acquire foreign laboratories through mergers and acquisitions. It is estimated that, on average, the largest OECD multinational firms now conduct 15 to 20 per cent of their research abroad. This varies by country with large firms headquartered in smaller nations such as the Netherlands and Belgium performing more than 50 per cent of their Research and Development outside their home country. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Norway, the share  of industrial Research and Development conducted outside the country by national firms may range as high as 30 to 40 per cent. German and French firms tend to conduct about 15 per cent of their research abroad, followed by US firms (10 per cent) and Japanese firms (less than 10 per cent). Investment in foreign Research and Development is a phenomenon that occurs between a relatively small number of countries, primarily in the OECD zone. There are a few non- OECD countries which have attracted a share of Research and Development investments, notably India and Singapore. 2. The factors driving the globalisation of research are becoming more complicated and diverse. Traditionally, the propensity to invest in research abroad correlated with the internationalisation of a companys other functions such as manufacturing and marketing. Market access is still an important factor in the globalisation of research, particularly for sectors such as automobiles and consumer electronics which have high levels of foreign manufacturing. As product cycles shorten and technology becomes more complex, more Research and Development facilities are located near foreign plants to ensure speedy transfer of knowledge from Research and Development to manufacturing. In recent years, personnel access and knowledge access have become more significant factors in the globalisation of research. The most recent wave of foreign research investment by biotechnology and information technology firms has been oriented towards tapping into foreign sources of skilled personnel, knowledge and technology. This is often investment in laboratories located separately from the production facilities of the parent company and more focused on basic rather than applied research. Other factors such as input costs, regulations and investment incentives have proven to be less important drivers for setting up foreign Research and Development sites. These trends have left governments both of countries that host foreign research sites and of home countries of firms that invest in Research and Development abroad concerned about the implications for domestic growth and development. Governments, however, can implement certain policy approaches to capture the considerable benefits associated with both inward and outward foreign Research and Development investments. This generally involves upgrading the technology base and strengthening the linkages within national innovation systems in order to obtain knowledge spillovers. It may also involve establishing the appropriate conditions for the creation of localised knowledge clusters or centres of expertise, which attract foreign Research and Development investments. These conditions include the excellence of universities and research institutions, a skilled and flexible labour pool, a broad network of suppliers, access to venture capital and the strength of intellectual property protection. Increasingly, the most important locational factors for the globalisation of research are the drive to reduce technology transfer costs within multinational firms and the ability to tap into foreign sources of technology and know-how.	home country *** research and development activities *** research and development expenditures *** globalisation of research *** globalisation of research *** knowledge transfer *** globalisation of research *** research investments *** technological knowledge *** information technology *** applied research *** host country *** home country *** research and development expenditures *** policy approaches *** national innovation systems *** research and development expenditures *** venture capital *** intellectual property *** research organisations *** globalisation of research *** technology transfer	internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)8/REV1	PROPOSALS FOR THEMATIC WORKSHOPS	1997	M	The following are proposals for thematic workshops to be held in conjunction with future meetings of the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) and which are intended to more closely examine issues raised in the context of TIPs main activities. The next two workshops will be on PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for Technology Development (10 December 1997) and Science and Technology Indicators for the Knowledge-Based Economy (17 June 1998); it is envisioned that two workshops a year will be held. ANTICIPATED WORKSHOPS ARE: (1) National Innovation Systems: Policy Implications: This workshop will explore the contribution of national innovation systems (NIS) analysis and general systemic approaches to policy-making in science and technology. This workshop will also help identify the most promising avenues for future OECD work on national innovation systems. (2) Technology Diagnostics of chabadu chabados: For increased effectiveness, government programmes for technology diffusion and other innovation schemes need to be tailored to the particular technology-related capabilities of firms. An effort will be made to identify best practices in government diagnostics and benchmarking programmes regarding tools and methodologies, target enterprises and sectors, and follow-up assistance. (3) Venture Capital for Technology-based Firms: Governments influence the supply of private sector venture capital through the regulatory, tax and legal frameworks they establish, as well as through creating conditions for the emergence of business angels.  Many governments also maintain publicly-funded schemes to provide loans, equity capital, loan guarantees, equity guarantees and tax incentives to small, innovative  firms. Among  the topics to be discussed will be the most effective configuration of government venture capital frameworks and programmes and the advantages and disadvantages of direct government intervention. (4) Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation: Focusing primarily on patents, the workshop would explore different national approaches to intellectual property protection, assignment of patent rights in universities and government laboratories, effects on small firms, relation to commercialisation and technology transfer,  and  implications for research co-operation at the national and international levels. (5) Science and Technology Labour Markets: It will assess concerns regarding future shortages of certain types  of  technology labourers (e.g. information technology workers) and expected surpluses of other Science and Technology workers (e.g. certain Ph.D. researchers). Among the factors to be explored are the effects of new technologies on skill levels and job qualifications; training and continuing education of scientists and technology workers; and personnel mobility and immigration patterns. (6) Foreign Access to Technology Programmes : This workshop will deepen the analysis of issues relating to participation by foreign firms in government-funded technology programmes. Special attention would be given to approaches for maximising benefits to both foreign firms and host governments from foreign participation in national Research and Development endeavours and means for facilitating international technology co-operation. (7) Globalisation of Industrial Research: This workshop will deepen the analysis of the factors contributing to foreign investment in Research and Development. The workshop would explore the role of clusters and knowledge centres within innovation systems in attracting foreign research investments.	public private partnerships *** technology development *** knowledge-based economy *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** small and medium sized firms *** technology diffusion *** government programmes *** best practices *** venture capital *** business angels *** technology based firms *** private sector *** tax incentives *** venture capital *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** technology commercialisation *** international level *** intellectual property *** technology transfer *** labour market *** science and technology personnel *** information technology *** personnel mobility *** new technologies *** foreign firms *** technology programmes *** foreign firms *** international technology co-operation *** research investments *** foreign direct investment *** innovation systems *** research investments	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(97)9	TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION FOLLOW-UP: DIAGNOSTIC AND BENCHMARKING TOOLS	1997	R	1. This paper reviews the forms of government action to promote the development, diffusion and use of diagnostic and benchmarking tools, as a way to enhance technology-related learning and innovation management capabilities of chabadu chabados. It has been prepared in the context of the TIP Group work on best practices in technology and innovation policy, as a background for its discussion of future work on technology diffusion policies. It could also contribute to the TIP project on National Innovation Systems, especially the workshop on the development of practical tools for improving the innovation performance of firms, organised jointly by Canada, France and the OECD (Paris, 30 June-1 July 1997). Technology diffusion policy in transition 2. Recent years have seen a gradual shift from traditional supply-side diffusion measures toward policies that reflect a more interactive model of innovation and recognise innovation and diffusion as interdependent processes. The growing realisation that the impact of technological development on productivity, growth and job creation greatly depend on the receptor and innovation capacity of firms has prompted changes in technology diffusion policies. They were traditionally aimed at facilitating technology transfer from research institutions or equipment suppliers to users (Level 1 goal in Table 1).

DSTI/STP/TIP(98)1/REV1	TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION: DRAFT MINISTERIAL ISSUES PAPER	1998	R	1. Knowledge is a decisive factor in economic growth; invested know-how - rather than raw materials or capital - now accounts for most of the value of many products and highlights the importance of technology and innovation. The recognition of knowledge as an economic good, and its role in the development of knowledge-based economies, raises special issues for OECD policy-makers. While enhancing investments in knowledge and technology development is clearly important, there is no consensus on the role of government versus that of the private sector. Government resources are also dwindling. The rationale for technology and innovation policies has evolved beyond correcting market failures in Research and Development to leveraging private funds and increasing the effectiveness of technology-related investments. Governments need to address systemic failures stemming from institutional rigidities and insufficient interaction and networking within innovation systems. Governments are also trying to reap  the benefits of the globalisation of industrial research and facilitate growth based on collaborative international technology efforts.	economic growth *** knowledge-based economy *** technology development *** private sector *** technological knowledge *** market failures *** systemic failures *** innovation systems	objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)10	TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL Research and Development EXPENDITURES	1998	R	1. Research and development related to the environment constitutes a small but growing share of the government research portfolio in the OECD area. On average, OECD governments appropriate about 2 per cent of their Research and Development budgets to research on the environment, as narrowly defined. However, this share rises to an estimated 5 per cent when environment-related research on other objectives is added, such as that on energy, agriculture and the atmosphere. Research in many technology fields - such as biotechnology and information technology - can lead to beneficial environmental spillovers. Since the early 1980s, growth in environmental research by the public sector has outpaced most other research areas so that its share of the total has increased slightly. However, given the pressing nature of many ecological concerns, government expenditures on environmental research remain low by most measures. 2. Certain broad trends are evident in the type of environmental research being conducted. In many countries, the environmental research done by governments is science-based and mostly concerned with understanding natural phenomena and sources of pollution.  More and more energy-related research can  be characterised as environmental since it is oriented towards climate change concerns, renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency. Similarly, more agricultural research is concerned with ecological impacts, such as minimising adverse effects from pesticides and other chemicals. At the same time, governments are increasing their research partnerships with industry to develop broad enabling technologies in manufacturing, monitoring and distribution which will have implications for the environment. 3. Countries differ in the level and content of their environmental research. The United States and Japan, both countries with large Research and Development budgets, devote a smaller share of research spending to the environment than do many European countries, such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. The focus of research varies by country, with the Netherlands devoting a large share to soil and groundwater concerns and other countries such as the United Kingdom focusing on the global atmosphere. In some countries, environmental research is carried out mostly by government laboratories or institutes, while in others universities play a larger role. Countries with large environmental goods and services industries - e.g. the United States, Japan and Germany - have more active industry participation in environmental research.	technology fields *** information technology *** public sector *** research and development expenditures	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)11	TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT: ENVIRONMENT-RELATED ISSUES	1998	R	1. Advanced sensors, biotechnology and clean cars top the list of important environmental technologies for the future identified by the technology foresight exercises of the major OECD countries. Also on the consensus list are new product recycling technologies, smart water and waste treatment, micro-manufacturing, and advances in renewable energy and photovoltaics. Environmental issues are becoming predominant in foresight surveys which highly rank technologies for achieving sustainable development goals. According to these surveys, technical advances to address both local and global environmental problems are among the most important for the future. 2. Technology foresight helps countries identify significant areas for research and development. It aids in setting priorities for government research in an era of tight budgets. It indicates areas for investigation by industry. Foresight exercises target technologies which are needed for achieving social goals in areas such as health and environment as well as economic objectives such as industrial competitiveness. As markets for environmental goods and services increase, picking the right environmental technologies is both good for the environment and good for business. And the process of technology foresight - carried out through Delphi surveys, large-scale consultations or developing lists of critical technologies - itself is valuable in forging linkages between society and research. Environment-related technology foresight is creating networks of people sharing a common view of how to realise sustainable development. Environmental technology is not a distinct field like advanced materials. It is a technology defined by its objective of protecting the environment, whether it be biotechnology or information technology.  Foresight results show that environmental technology is diffuse and often interdisciplinary.  It is also an area that requires long time horizons to develop. Sustained government research support is crucial in areas where industry may underinvest. Environmental policy needs to join forces with technology policy in driving the development of the key technologies which will underpin sustainable growth in OECD countries.	foresight exercises *** environmental technologies *** sustainable development *** environmental problems *** foresight exercises *** priority setting *** foresight exercises *** environmental technologies *** foresight exercises *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises *** environmental technologies *** information technology *** environmental technologies *** support research *** environmental policy *** foresight exercises	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)12	COMMERCIALISATION OF GOVERNMENT-FUNDED RESEARCH: BACKGROUND REPORT	1998	R	1. OECD countries are keenly interested in expanding the commercial exploitation of government- funded research. The aims of such policies are a combination of: (1) shifting a greater research burden to the private sector; (2) economising on scarce government research funds; (3) increasing the efficiency of public research expenditures; and (4) fostering more innovation by establishing linkages among various parts of the research base. But no single best commercialisation strategy can be identified as the structure of science systems differs substantially across OECD countries. The problems governments encounter in transferring technologies from the public to the private sector, the policy tools they have at their disposal, and their national policy objectives are quite varied. For example, countries whose public sectors fund  and perform a large share of national research and development must focus on improving the technological absorption capabilities of national firms. Countries in which the government funds a low share of total research expenditures  Japan and Korea, for example  are trying to increase the quality of the public research base. 2. Government commercialisation strategies essentially consist of: (1) establishing the appropriate framework conditions; (2) encouraging entrepreneurship in the public sector; (3) facilitating partnerships with the private sector; and (4) stimulating innovation through network formation. Governments are trying to change the incentives for collaboration between public and private entities, simplify and deregulate the types of interactions, and reduce the costs and risks associated with partnerships. Governments are also involved in building the bridging institutions that provide the necessary information, facilities and capital to transform technologies and processes in the public sector into commercial products. However, there are few evaluations of these commercialisation schemes. Despite indicators on patents, licenses, royalties and spin-off firms, it is difficult to measure the outputs of research and the rate at which they are transferred to the private sector and incorporated into new or improved products and processes. In some countries, there is evidence of improvement in the amount of commercially-relevant technologies generated by the public sector and in the level of interaction between private and public research institutes. However, it is harder to capture more subtle forms of technology transfer  such as incremental improvements in processes or products  or longer-term effects such as improvements in productivity or employment. More systematic evaluation of the costs and benefits of commercialisation policies would aid in directing government investments to the most effective commercialisation approaches and infrastructures.	funded research *** public research *** funded research *** research base *** private sector *** science system *** policy profiles *** private sector *** public sector *** public research *** research base *** stimulating innovation *** framework conditions *** public sector *** private sector *** public sector *** private sector *** research organisations *** public sector *** technology transfer *** funded research	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)2	GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES FOR DIFFUSING ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY	1998	R	Technology holds the key to addressing many environmental problems and achieving sustainable patterns of economic growth. In many cases, the appropriate technological solution already exists. However, the technology may not be in widespread use because of its price, the lack of information on the part of firms or other market failures. OECD governments are implementing a number of innovative schemes to disseminate information about environmental technologies and to promote enhanced use of these techniques among a greater number of enterprises, both large and small. An important aspect of these programmes is informing firms of the benefits of environmental technologies in terms of efficiency, performance and profits. There are many types of environmental technology diffusion programmes and services on offer. Providing information is at the core of all diffusion programmes and this is increasingly being done through electronic networks such as the Internet. Also prominent are demonstration programmes, which illustrate the technical feasibility and benefits of new environmental technologies, and benchmarking schemes, which help firms compare their environmental performance to that of similar enterprises. Technical assistance programmes provide more hands-on advice in diagnosing environmental problems and finding the appropriate technological solutions. Governments are increasingly mounting soft diffusion activities which focus on workforce training and encouraging managerial and organisational changes within firms to improve their ability to assess and adapt environmental technologies. Lastly, financial assistance is often provided in differing degrees to facilitate industry adoption of new environmental approaches. Some technology diffusion approaches and schemes seem to work better than others in terms of disseminating technologies and improving the environmental performance of firms: (1) Giving effective incentives. Environmental regulations and other well-designed policy instruments are generally the most effective incentive to the adoption of new technology; however, direct and indirect financial incentives can also be key for changing technologies. (2) Promoting clean technologies. Diffusion programmes should be focused on disseminating clean technologies, which entail changes in processes and products, rather than add-on or end-of-pipe techniques. (3) Targeting sectors and problems. The most effective technology diffusion programmes tend to target specific industrial sectors and/or certain types of environmental problems identified through audits. (4) Orienting programmes locally. Diffusion programmes should have the ability to reach and interact with enterprises as close to home as possible, with the best programmes incorporating both local and national elements. (5) Providing integrated services. The integration of information sources and technology diffusion services into a broad co-operating network facilitates ease of access for users.	economic growth *** environmental problems *** market failures *** environmental technologies *** environmental technologies *** environmental technologies *** technology diffusion programmes *** diffusion programmes *** environmental performance *** environmental technologies *** environmental problems *** environmental technologies *** environmental performance *** technology diffusion *** technological change *** new technologies *** policy instruments *** clean technologies *** diffusion programmes *** clean technologies *** business sector *** technology diffusion programmes *** environmental problems *** diffusion programmes *** technology diffusion *** government programmes *** environmental technologies	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development

DSTI/STP/TIP(98)3/REV1	PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR DEVELOPING ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY	1998	R	1. Because continued technical innovation is vital to achieving sustainable development goals, joint government-industry action is needed to foster the development of clean industrial products and processes. Public/private research partnerships are key to developing environmental technologies which can contribute to both sustainable development and industrial competitiveness. Such partnerships leverage private investments in environment-related innovation and direct it towards critical research needs. 2. Partnerships are necessary because certain obstacles to the development and diffusion of clean technologies remain. Most governments confront severe constraints on their research and technology budgets, of which environment-related research is not a large component, and PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS are a means for doing more with less. They stimulate innovation in integrated processes and clean technologies which might not be pursued by industry on its own, since end-of-pipe treatments may appear cheaper and pay-back periods on clean technology investments appear long. Partnerships help overcome information gaps, seek to involve smaller firms in diverse sectors, and can demonstrate the cost- effectiveness of new technologies. They also facilitate interdisciplinary research and enhance networking among actors in the innovation process, including enterprises, universities and government research laboratories and institutes. 3. There is now a marked convergence in the technical focus of research partnerships for sustainable development. The emphasis has definitely shifted from end-of-pipe to clean technologies. Energy-related considerations are being merged with environmental aspects in the context of addressing climate change concerns. The fact that pre-competitive clean car technology development is included in most government programmes is not a coincidence nor is the frequent focus on the development and use  of biotechnology for addressing environmental problems. Other shared research topics include recycling (of wastes, consumer goods, hazardous gases, etc.), the development of closed-loop production processes, and the greening of product design through Design for Environment projects. These common research areas point to the emergence of an international consensus on technologies that are most needed in the sustainability context and that may form the basis of industrial competitiveness in the near future. Public/private research partnerships, by virtue of their ability to cut across institutions, firms and sectors, are a valuable mechanism for generating a wide range of technological innovations from pre-competitive, breakthrough discoveries to near-commercialisation sustainable technologies.	sustainable development *** sustainable development *** business research and development *** environmental technologies *** development and diffusion *** clean technologies *** public private partnerships *** clean technologies *** new technologies *** innovation process *** sustainable development *** clean technologies *** technology development *** government programmes *** environmental problems *** firms and sectors *** business research and development *** public private partnerships *** environmental technologies	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)4/REV2	GLOBALISATION OF INDUSTRIAL Research and Development: POLICY IMPLICATIONS	1998	R	1. The globalisation of industrial research and development has important policy implications for OECD countries. Governments are concerned about finding new ways to foster innovation domestically as companies reorganise their activities globally. Countries have legitimate concerns about maintaining an attractive domestic research base, which would discourage the flight of Research and Development abroad while simultaneously increasing the ability to attract technology intensive investments on a global basis. They are searching for mechanisms to integrate the research activities of foreign firms into the local economy and to maximise their domestic spillovers. And since advanced technological markets are increasingly found overseas, countries want their private sectors to better monitor and participate in these foreign centres of excellence. 2. The increasing pace of globalisation can be observed in the heightened importance of patenting by firms abroad; increases in the relative importance of both inward and outward research-related foreign direct investment; the explosion of international strategic alliances in science and technology; and increasing trade in technology. While these general trends touch all OECD members, they present different challenges for individual countries  depending mostly on their industrial structure, the size and openness of their economy and the strength of their science and technology base. In fact, the globalisation process has not markedly diminished differences in innovation systems and may be accentuating the technological specialisation of firms in different regions. 3. Governments in OECD countries are reacting to the pressures of globalisation primarily through policies designed to improve their domestic innovation capacity. They are reinforcing the basic framework conditions for industrial innovation, and in particular concentrating on the promotion of a highly skilled labour force and a vibrant research base. A related set of policy measures addresses any systemic failures that prevent different parts of the innovation system  the institutions necessary to industrial innovation  from working in harmony with one another. Governments can facilitate the flow of knowledge throughout the system by providing technologies and information to firms and institutions and by facilitating co-operation among actors. Cluster analysis is one method by which governments refine the range of possible interventions in the innovation system, by helping governments identify networks of firms, which can innovate together. An enhanced understanding of how firms are both globalising and clustering their Research and Development activities would help governments devise and implement the best innovation policies in an era of research globalisation.	research and development activities *** research base *** research activities *** foreign firms *** private sector *** foreign direct investment *** innovation systems *** globalisation process *** innovation capacity *** research base *** framework conditions *** industrial innovation *** skilled labour *** systemic failures *** innovation systems *** policy measures *** industrial innovation *** knowledge flows *** innovation systems *** globalisation of research *** research and development activities *** research and development activities	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** internationalisation_globalisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)5	PROPOSALS FOR THEMATIC WORKSHOPS	1998	M	8 topics are envisaged : (1) Commercialisation of Research : This workshop will examine trends and issues in the commercialisation of government-funded research. It will explore different national approaches to intellectual property protection, Human resource issues,  and the role  of  technology brokers, technology transfer offices, commercialisation units and other intermediaries. (2) Environment and Innovation : This workshop will examine the interplay between environmental policies and technology policies in stimulating innovation in industry, i.e. The effects of different types of environmental policy instruments (e.g. regulations, economic instruments, voluntary agreements), The role of technology policies in developing and diffusing environmental technology with Case studies of successful policies fostering the development and use of clean technologies. (3) Science and Technology Labour Markets : It will assess concerns regarding future shortages of certain types  of  technology labourers (e.g. information technology workers) and expected surpluses of other Science and Technology workers (e.g. certain Ph.D. researchers). Among the factors to be explored are the effects of new technologies on skill levels and job qualifications; training and continuing education of scientists and technology workers; and personnel mobility and immigration patterns ; (4)Evaluation of  Innovation Policies and Programmes : This workshop will review approaches for evaluating innovation policies and programmes, with   a view to identifying best practices in the evaluation of policies for stimulating efficient functioning of national innovation systems, particularly schemes intended to foster greater linkages among actors  in innovation systems, more flexibility in institutional roles and enhanced integration with other policy fields. It will analyse the need for accountability and transparency and the desire to minimise distortions arising from government policies while maximising their leverage in stimulating innovation are underlining the requirement for better evaluation practices. (5) Innovation in Services : Innovation in the services sector is increasingly considered key to improved macro-economic performance, but remains imperfectly understood. The nature of services innovation may be somewhat different from innovation in manufacturing; it may be less driven by direct Research and Development expenditure and be more dependent on acquired technology, organisational change and the quality of human resources. It may also be more closely linked to consumer needs than innovation in manufacturing. The workshop will address these issues as well  as  the interaction between manufacturing and services (e.g. in outsourcing), the sources and processes of services innovation, the links between the science system and the services  sector,  and  measurement aspects of innovation in services. The workshop will also discuss policies  that  may  be  particularly relevant to stimulating innovation in services, such as policies for small and medium-sized enterprises, cluster policies, public procurement, and research and development relevant to services. (6) Multidisciplinarity in Science and Technology : This workshop will examine trends in the development of multidisciplinarity in science and technology and the implications for government policies : for government research funding, the establishment of multidisciplinary research centres, the education and training of  scientists  and researchers, and maintaining flexibility in science and technology labour markets.  (7) Co-operative Industry Research and Development : The design of government policies to encourage collaborative research and development by firms will be discussed, including the effects on the research portfolios and diversification of  enterprises. Another topic relates to possible regulatory impediments to greater Research and Development collaboration among firms. It will also reflect ongoing work on the globalisation of industrial research and development and the place of strategic industrial alliances. (8) Technology Co-operation with Non-Member Countries : Topics for discussion include the design of agreements  for research collaboration and the development of infrastructures for technology co-operation and commercialisation, covering issues relating to standardisation, regulation and intellectual property rights.	commercialisation of research *** funded research *** intellectual property *** human resources *** technology transfer *** environmental policy *** industrial innovation *** stimulating innovation *** environmental policy *** policy instruments *** economic instruments *** clean technologies *** environmental technologies *** labour market *** information technology *** science and technology personnel *** new technologies *** best practices *** policy evaluations *** personnel mobility *** national innovation systems *** stimulating innovation *** services sector *** innovation in services *** human resources *** innovation in services *** research and development expenditures *** innovation in services *** science system *** stimulating innovation *** public procurement *** innovation in services *** funded research *** labour market *** collaborative research and development *** collaborative research and development *** research and development activities *** collaborative research *** intellectual property *** technology co-operation	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_human_resources *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_services *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_services *** other_policy_areas *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)6/REV1	NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: ANALYTICAL FINDINGS	1998	R	1. Determining how governments can better harness technological change to the benefit of economic growth and social progress, and learn from each others experiences, requires understanding how changing patterns in technology diffusion and innovation affect the performance of firms and the economy in different national contexts. Technological change can bring significant productivity gains and job creation when it is accompanied by organisational change and upgrading of skills. Innovative firms are therefore the main drivers of economic growth in a knowledge-based economy. The processes of innovation and technology diffusion are undergoing substantial changes, and national innovation and production systems are becoming more interdependent. Still, country-specific factors continue to shape firm-level innovation patterns and their impact on economic performance. 2. This report identifies the main distinctive features of national economies that have to be taken into account when evaluating policy challenges raised by the emergence of a knowledge-based economy:  Inherited patterns of scientific, technological and industrial specialisation. The report provides empirical evidence on diverging national patterns of specialisation.  Institutional profiles. The report shows important variations in the respective roles of the main actors in the innovation process (firms, public and private research organisations, and governments) as well as marked differences across countries regarding the main policy-making institutions.  Country size and level of development. The report devotes special attention to the specificities of national innovation systems in what are termed catching-up economies, especially the need to build an indigenous science and technology base and to move from a strategy based on imitation to an innovation policy.  Structures of knowledge interactions. The report analyses and compares national patterns of knowledge flows, among and between firms and non market institutions, and provides empirical evidence on the importance of labour mobility in the economy-wide diffusion of tacit knowledge. 3. Increasing the contribution of chabadi chabado and infrastructure to national economic performance requires evaluating more carefully their impact on:  Firm innovation capacity. The innovation capacities of a majority of firms, especially chabadu chabados, are limited, and innovative firms vary in their level of competence. The report identifies the main firm-level barriers to innovativeness that government can help lower by facilitating the diffusion of best practice innovation management and diagnostic tools.  Firm networking. The report synthesises new empirical studies which demonstrate that collaborative firms are more innovative than others; that network relationships are durable and trust-based and increasingly involve knowledge-intensive service firms; and that globalisation does not weaken but, on the contrary, often strengthens national networks.  Innovative cluster formation. Clusters of innovative firms are emerging as drivers of growth and employment, by acting as magnets for new technology, skilled personnel and research investments. These clusters differ in the mechanisms of knowledge-sharing and transfer. The report discusses how a cluster approach can be used for formulating and implementing technology and innovation policy.	economic growth *** technology diffusion *** technological change *** job creation *** technological change *** economic growth *** innovative firms *** knowledge-based economy *** innovation process *** technology diffusion *** knowledge-based economy *** research organisations *** innovation process *** business research and development *** national innovation systems *** labour mobility *** tacit knowledge *** knowledge flows *** innovation capacity *** innovative firms *** small and medium sized firms *** innovation capacity *** innovative firms *** best practices *** knowledge intensive services *** innovative firms *** research investments *** employment growth *** new technologies *** national innovation systems	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)7/REV1	NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: POLICY IMPLICATIONS	1998	R	5. The changing innovation climate provides OECD countries with unparalleled opportunities for economic growth and improved social well-being. However, to realise the full potential of new technologies for growth and jobs, OECD governments must respond effectively to the changing nature of the innovation process. They face the common task of strengthening innovation systems in an era of reduced resources, while the efficiency of some national policy instruments may be reduced by globalisation. Particularly important are the evolving needs of innovative firms, especially the small and newer ones. 6. Traditionally, governments have intervened in the technology arena to address market failures  when for example, firms under-invest in Research and Development due to the existence of spillovers which limit their ability to fully appropriate returns or due to the uncertainty associated with innovation  by measures aimed at increasing the volume of Research and Development, without enough consideration of how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing Research and Development. 7. The new role of governments requires that they also address systemic failures which block the functioning of the innovation system, hinder the flow of knowledge and technology and, consequently, reduce the overall efficiency of national Research and Development efforts. Such systemic failures can emerge from mismatches between the different components of an innovation system, such as conflicting incentives for market and non-market institutions, e.g. enterprises and the public research sector. Other market and systemic failures may result from institutional rigidities based on narrow specialisation, asymmetric information and communication gaps, and lack of networking or mobility of personnel.   8. Governments need to play an integrating role in managing knowledge on an economy-wide basis by making technology and innovation policy an integral part of overall economic policy. This involves:  Securing framework conditions that are conducive to innovation. Science, technology and innovation policies need to operate in a stable macroeconomic environment and complement broader reforms in other fields. These include competition policies to enhance innovation-driving competition but also facilitate collaborative research; education and training policies to develop the necessary human capital (Austria, Finland); regulatory reform policies to lessen administrative burdens and institutional rigidities; financial and fiscal policies to ease the flow of capital to small firms; labour market policies to enhance the mobility of personnel and strengthen tacit knowledge flows; communications policies to maximise the dissemination of information and enable the growth of electronic networks; foreign investment and trade policies to strengthen technology diffusion on a global basis; and regional policies to improve the complementarity between different levels of government initiatives.  Refocusing the specific objectives and adapting the instruments of technology and innovation policy. Policies to promote research collaboration, facilitate firm networking and clustering, encourage institutional ties, diffuse technology and increase personnel mobility take on a new significance. Governments must also ensure that long-term technological opportunities are safeguarded through adequate support to basic and pre-competitive research. And new approaches may be required to enhance national benefits from the globalisation of production and research. 9. New approaches or institutional arrangements, including PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, may be needed to co-ordinate the formulation and implementation of these policies (Korea). Better techniques and institutional mechanisms for evaluation are in many countries a prerequisite for improving decision making across the traditional delineation of administrative competencies, and can spur innovation in government (Switzerland, United Kingdom). 10. In practice, many science and technology policies remain piecemeal, with insufficient attention given to fostering interactions and spillovers at the national and international levels. Although situations vary, this confronts OECD policy-makers with a number of common challenges in addressing a range of issues ranging from innovation culture through technology diffusion to the creation of knowledge.	economic growth *** innovation process *** new technologies *** policy instruments *** innovation systems *** innovative firms *** market failures *** systemic failures *** technological knowledge *** knowledge flows *** innovation systems *** systemic failures *** innovation systems *** public research sector *** systemic failures *** personnel mobility *** framework conditions *** regulatory reform *** small and medium sized firms *** collaborative research *** competition policy *** technology diffusion *** tacit knowledge *** personnel mobility *** labour market *** knowledge flows *** foreign direct investment *** collaborative research *** technology diffusion *** personnel mobility *** public private partnerships *** policy implementation *** institutional arrangements *** international level *** technology diffusion *** national innovation systems	objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)8	PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: AN OVERVIEW	1998	R	1. High research costs and stagnating government Research and Development budgets underlie the exploding number of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in science and technology in the OECD area. Industry is joining forces with public research  universities, laboratories and institutes  and combining resources  financial, technical, physical and human  to maximise benefits from Research and Development and stimulate innovation. For governments, these partnerships help correct market failures which can lead to underinvestment by enterprises in critical or risky research areas. They can also heighten the efficiency of government-funded research by reducing overlap, directing it towards market needs, speeding diffusion and generally leveraging the impact of dwindling public research funds. 2. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS in science and technology exist in several modes and types. Research partnerships between firms and universities have been the most common. Now, joint research with government research institutes, laboratories and other bodies are becoming more prevalent, particularly in countries where universities play a lesser role in national Research and Development. Governments are attempting to involve more smaller firms in partnership initiatives as well as to link small and large firms together in the public research context. Among the technologies increasingly being targeted are energy and environment-related innovations and emerging interdisciplinary fields. 3. Not all PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS succeed and design is crucial. Different types of partnerships require different funding arrangements as well as incentive structures such as frameworks for protecting intellectual property. Partnerships should be designed to maximise the contribution of industry through cost-sharing but also to limit the risk of opportunistic behaviour by firms. And these partnerships cannot replace government financing of certain types of Research and Development, in particular generic and longer-term research, which is critical to innovation and the foundation of future economic growth.	public private partnerships *** public research *** market failures *** public research *** funded research *** public private partnerships *** research organisations *** public research *** public private partnerships *** incentive structures *** intellectual property *** economic growth *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP(98)9	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LABOUR MARKETS: MOBILITY AND FLEXIBILITY	1998	R	1. In knowledge-based economies, the mobility of skilled science and technology labour takes on new importance in sustaining innovation and economic growth. Personnel mobility is key to diffusing knowledge and technology and to facilitating structural adjustment in the economy. Recent shortages of personnel in certain high-technology sectors and occupations raise concerns about possible barriers to labour mobility and flexibility in the OECD area. However, it is unclear whether current skilled labour shortages in some OECD countries are cyclical or structural in nature. Barriers to mobility can generally stem from restrictions on hiring and firing, pension rules, housing market distortions and wage bargaining arrangements. In the public research sector (universities and government laboratories/institutes), additional factors such as tenure can act as a disincentive to mobility. 2. While the degree of labour mobility and the underlying factors affecting it vary across countries, there are some common patterns. The mobility of science and technology labour depends largely on field of expertise, demographic factors, educational qualifications and tenure arrangements. The majority of university graduates in science and technology move to the private sector, although many are no longer entering traditional science-related occupations. The situation of PhD graduates varies, with the public research sector in some OECD countries acquiring and holding a large share of the most highly-educated technical personnel. Movement of labour from industry to the public sector is weak in all countries. Data suggest overall labour mobility in the science and technology sector is higher in North America and Australia than in Japan and several European countries. International mobility of science and technology personnel appears to be increasing, with the United States the largest beneficiary of brain gain. A problem in monitoring the national and international mobility of science and technology labour is the lack of systematic data, with the exception of the Nordic countries who maintain administrative registers. The OECD Jobs Study outlined reforms in the areas of wage flexibility and labour mobility which can aid firms and workers to better respond to technology-induced changes in labour market demand. Science and technology policies can play a complementary role in reducing barriers that inhibit mobility between the public and private research sectors, ensuring appropriate education and training in technical fields, encouraging networking and PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, and promoting diffusion of information regarding trends in skilled labour markets. In the 21st century, science and technology personnel will need a broader range of interdisciplinary knowledge, a good grounding in information technology and computer skills, and an ability to adapt skills to fast-changing technical fields	economic growth *** labour market *** knowledge-based economy *** technological knowledge *** diffusion of knowledge *** personnel mobility *** labour mobility *** skilled labour *** public research sector *** labour mobility *** labour market *** private sector *** public research sector *** public sector *** labour mobility *** international mobility *** science and technology personnel *** international mobility *** labour market *** labour mobility *** labour market *** public private partnerships *** skilled labour *** business research and development *** labour market *** information technology *** science and technology personnel *** labour market	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)1	MANAGING INNOVATION SYSTEMS	1999	R	1. The current wave of scientific discoveries and technical advances provides OECD countries with unparalleled opportunities for economic growth and improved social well being. But the rapid increase in new scientific and technological knowledge only provides economic and social benefits when it is effectively exploited and leads to innovation. Innovation is a key driver of long-term economic growth, the primary basis for competitiveness in world markets and part of the response to many societal challenges. While public expectations towards technological innovation are  evolving  with  social  concerns (e.g. unemployment, sustainable development, ageing populations), the innovation process itself is undergoing profound changes. Public policies must adapt effectively to such changes. Governments face the common task of strengthening innovation systems in order to take greater advantage of globalisation and the move to a knowledge-based economy. 2. This report summarises the main findings of the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP) work on national innovation systems  and related work in the context of the project on Technology, Productivity and Job Creation  which was aimed at: (1) characterising the current transformation of the innovation process; (2) identifying the main country-specific and other factors that determine innovation patterns and performance; and (3) determining the implications for government policy to promote innovation. The changing climate and conditions for innovation 3. Innovation at its core is the ability to manage knowledge creatively in responding to market-articulated demands and other social needs. Enterprises are the main source of innovation, but their performance depends on the incentives provided by the economic and regulatory environment, their access to critical inputs (via factor markets or through interactions within networks and clusters of knowledge-based organisations) and their internal capacity to seize market and technological opportunities. Several trends combine to change the conditions for successful innovation:  Innovation increasingly relies on a well-functioning interaction between the science base and the business sector. The innovative process in all sectors is increasingly characterised by feedback between the science base and the different stages of technology development and commercialisation. In some fields such as biotechnology, scientific research is the main source of innovation, blurring the distinction between science and technology. A greater part of the agenda of scientific research is driven by problems identified during the course of technological development in the business sector.  More competitive markets and the accelerating pace of scientific and technological change force firms to innovate more rapidly. Together with the expanding range of technologies which firms must manage or master, this is exerting pressure on business Research and Development and may be squeezing out private investment in long-term applied research. This is occurring in a context where budget constraints and cuts in defence-related Research and Development have generally led to stagnation in spending on research and development in the public sector. This may have implications for long-term innovative capacity.  Networking and collaboration between firms are now more important than in the past and increasingly involve knowledge-intensive services. Competition is key in providing incentives to   innovate, but networking and collaboration at local, national and international levels are often necessary to build the capabilities to do so. Clusters of innovative firms and other private and public knowledge-based organisations are emerging as drivers of growth and employment. Two-thirds of OECD production and 70% of jobs are in services, where innovation is generally less driven by direct Research and Development expenditure and more dependent on acquired technology and the quality of human resources. Moreover, innovative manufacturing firms are increasingly interacting with knowledge-intensive services.  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially new technology-based firms, have a more important role in the development and diffusion of new technologies. Small enterprises, especially new technology-based firms, play a distinctive and increasing role within innovation systems. Beyond their direct contribution to the creation and diffusion of new goods and services, new technology-based firms help instil a culture of innovation, encourage investments in skills and improve economy-wide dynamic allocative efficiency. However, the conditions for their creation and growth are still far from optimum in a majority of countries and the innovation capacities of a majority of chabadu chabados are still limited.  The globalisation of economies is making the innovation systems of countries more interdependent. Trade in technology is growing, as are international alliances among firms and cross-border purchases of patents and licenses. Investment in foreign research facilities is also on the rise, particularly by firms based in smaller home countries. In this environment, the competitiveness of firms depends more and more on their ability to link to international innovation networks. However, globalisation is not leading to a homogenisation of national innovation patterns. Countries still differ greatly due to various starting points, technological and industrial specialisation, institutions, policies and attitudes to change. 4. In sum, innovation performance depends not only on how specific actors (e.g. enterprises, research institutes, universities) perform, but on how they interact with one another as elements of an innovation system, at local, national and international levels.	economic growth *** scientific discoveries *** technological knowledge *** economic growth *** societal challenges *** innovation process *** sustainable development *** innovation systems *** knowledge-based economy *** innovation process *** job creation *** national innovation systems *** business sector *** science base *** science base *** technology development *** scientific research *** business sector *** scientific research *** technology development *** technological change *** business research and development *** applied research *** public sector *** innovation capacity *** knowledge intensive services *** international level *** employment growth *** innovative firms *** human resources *** research and development expenditures *** knowledge intensive services *** development and diffusion *** technology based firms *** new technologies *** innovation systems *** technology based firms *** new technologies *** technology based firms *** new technologies *** small and medium sized firms *** innovation capacity *** innovation systems *** home country *** innovation performance *** research organisations *** innovation systems *** international level *** innovation systems	policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)11	THE NIS FOCUS GROUPS:  A PROGRESS REPORT	1999	P	In its previous phase,  which  ended in  Spring 1999, the  NIS-project evolved around  two tracks: (1) general analysis involving all countries; and (2) more in-depth analysis of specific aspects carried out by volunteer countries within six focus groups: Innovative firms, Innovative firm networks, Clusters, Mobility of human resources, Organisational mapping, and Catching-up economies. the TIP Group suggested some streamlining of the project content and organisation to sharpen policy focus. 3 groups groups created: Clusters; Mobility of human resources; and Innovative firms and networks. The main objectives of the focus groups are the following: (a) Focus group on clusters: to explore to what extent and in which respects clusters differ in their innovation performance and mechanisms of knowledge sharing and transfer, with a view to derive concrete implications for cluster-based innovation policy. In this phase, the focus group will concentrate its work on: Improving and applying the common methodology for macro-clustering; Comparing selected individual clusters internationally; and Developing and applying a typology of clusters based on their innovation patterns. (b) Focus group on innovative firms and networks: to define characteristics of firms and networks of firms that hamper or promote innovative activities, with a view to determining how government policy can directly or indirectly help increase the stock of innovative firms. The work will devote special attention to three themes: The dynamics of networks, including in the service sector; Policies to enhance innovative capacities of firms; The role of policy in stimulating co-operation and networking. (c) Focus group on mobility of human resources: to analyse the role of the mobility of human resources in the circulation of knowledge within a NIS. The work will follow three lines: Benchmarking of internal mobility rates across the participating countries; A study of international mobility in terms of brain drain and gain; and Recommendations for the development of relevant indicators. Progress reports on each group. (a) Clusters: comparative case study work should be emphasised in this stage, With regard to policy implications it was stressed that the groups should look beyond cluster policies per se, by considering how the adoption of a cluster perspective in innovation policy making affects other policy areas (such as education, competition policies etc). The cluster case studies should provide some of the insights necessary for such widening of the policy analysis. (b) Human resources: In this new phase, the primary objective is to assess and compare mobility rates over a longer period and to use other data sources than registers, first and foremost the rather standardised Labour Force Surveys (LFS) that are available for most OECD countries. This will feed two main areas of research: Benchmarking of mobility rates across the participating countries; An exploratory study of mobility outcomes in terms of brain drain and gain. (c) innovative firms & networks. Main substantive issues for co-operation/collaboration/networking among firms (and other entities): are they becoming more important for innovation? Which forms do they take? Are there differences between Countries? Sectors and clusters? What are the factors driving co-operation? The concept of core-competencies, Outsourcing of Research and Development? What role do endogenous factors (trust, learning effects, competencies, experience, etc.) and  exogenous factors (market structure, product life cycle, etc.) play? What is the rationale and scope for policy in promoting co-operation? Main issues for innovative firms: creating a clear linkage between the capacities that firms need in order to be more innovative, and the policy measures that help them progressively develop those capacities.	human resources *** innovative firms *** human resources *** innovative firms *** innovation performance *** innovation activities *** innovative firms *** innovation capacity *** services sector *** human resources *** international mobility *** policy areas *** competition policy *** human resources *** innovative firms *** life cycle *** innovative firms *** policy measures	policy_area_human_resources *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_human_resources *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)12	INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE - DEVELOPING THE LINKS	1999	R	1. This paper examines the impact of innovation and technological change on economic growth and analyses the role of policy in enhancing the contribution of innovation and technological change to growth. The current draft of the paper is primarily intended to set the scene and develop some of the key links between innovation and economic performance. The paper draws the following conclusions:  Cross-country disparities in growth of GDP and GDP per capita have increased in the OECD in the 1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. Only a limited number of countries have seen a pick up in growth performance in the 1990s. Some of these countries (Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway and the United States) have also experienced a pick up in multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth that is partly due to greater innovation and technological change.  Innovation and technological change are important determinants of economic growth, as is demonstrated by a wide range of empirical studies, at the firm, sector and economy-wide level. Innovation is a core business activity, which is undertaken to increase market share, cut costs or improve profitability. Information technology, in particular, is a key factor in labour productivity performance. It has had strong impacts on firm productivity, particularly when accompanied by organisational change and higher worker skills. It has helped to enhance performance in previously stagnant services sectors, has reduced transaction costs, and is crucial in enabling greater networking and co-operation.  Recent changes in the innovation process have affected the growth process in important ways. First, innovation is more market-driven than it was in the past. Second, innovation is more global and emerges from many sources. Third, innovation is more widespread across sectors, thus broadening the basis for economic growth. Information technology, in particular, has an important role in strengthening innovation and growth in the service sector. Fourthly, innovation relies much more on networking and co-operation, including links between science and industry. These changes imply that the role of government is now different than it was in the past.  Differences in economic performance across countries may be linked to the degree in which firms, scientific institutions and governments have adapted to the changes in the innovation process. The United States, in particular, seems to have been successful in adapting to the changing requirements for innovation and growth. Over the past two decades, it has introduced a series of legislative measures to strengthen competition, facilitate networking and co-operation, strengthen links between science and industry and enhance the returns to investment in Research and Development. Federal funding for generic technologies, such as information technology, has contributed to scientific and technological breakthroughs, that are now supporting economic performance.  Other OECD countries with strong economic performance, such as Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands, are much smaller than the United States. In these circumstances, openness to technologies from abroad is crucial. The small scientific basis of such countries implies that it is unlikely that important technological breakthroughs will emerge from domestic research only. However, when countries are specialised in certain technological fields, a strong knowledge base in such areas is essential. For instance, the high Research and Development investment of Finland   and Sweden is a basic requirement for the ability of these countries to compete in high-tech fields such as the production of communications equipment.  More generally, the small successful OECD countries have in common that they have all undertaken a broad programme of structural reform. In fact, several of these countries have been singled out as having implemented many of the recommendations of the OECD Jobs Strategy. The reform process has improved the business climate, strengthened competition, pushed firms to improve performance, and enabled innovation to flourish. Most of these successful economies (Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States) have also been identified in previous OECD work as having well functioning innovation systems. 2. The policy implications of this analysis will require further consideration. It is clear, however, that the policy requirements in the area of technology and innovation are significantly different than they were in the past. Policies to strengthen competition are important, but not sufficient. Improved knowledge flows within the economy, by improved networking and co-operation, and between the domestic economy and other countries, are crucial areas for consideration by policy makers. To benefit from globally produced knowledge, investment in domestic knowledge is also of growing importance. Delegates may wish to consider the following issues for discussion: a) How have changes in the innovation process affected the relationship between innovation and economic growth? Do the greater role of market forces, the increasingly global character of innovation and the growing role of networking imply a fresh potential for innovation and growth? b) What role can technology and innovation policy play in strengthening growth performance? Which policy reforms are the most essential in responding to the new conditions for innovation? c) What are the main reforms in countries with strong economic and innovation performance that have been undertaken to improve performance? To what extent do country size and specialisation matter in designing such reforms? Should - and can - governments promote greater specialisation? d) What are the main dilemmas in policy design that have to be confronted by policy makers? How can networking and co-operation be improved while ensuring sufficient competition? How can a sufficient creation of basic knowledge be ensured?	economic growth *** technological change *** technological change *** economic growth *** technological change *** information technology *** services sector *** innovation process *** economic growth *** innovation and growth *** information technology *** services sector *** innovation process *** innovation and growth *** research investments *** information technology *** knowledge base *** technology fields *** research and development expenditures *** innovation systems *** knowledge flows *** economic growth *** innovation process *** innovation and growth *** innovation performance	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)13	INNOVATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT - ISSUES FOR THE JUNE 2000 TIP WORKSHOP	1999	W2	Objectives: The aim of this workshop is to examine the role of environmental policy in stimulating environmental innovation and of innovation policy in enhancing environmental performance  for sustainable economic growth and development. The workshop will focus on issues raised by the need for increased consistency in the design and implementation of policy in the innovation and environment areas. It will also discuss policy measures that can enhance the development and diffusion of innovations responding to environmental concerns. Issues: There has been a series of studies by the TIP Group and other related bodies on issues in this area, all of which point to the importance of innovation policies in improving environmental performance and of environmental policies in stimulating innovation. The issues involved are the following. (i) Designing environmental policies to stimulate innovation. Innovation policies to enhance environmental sustainability need to address market and systemic failures by stimulating innovation and diffusion of environmental innovations. Correcting market failure rests on designing environmental  policies that send more appropriate price signals for environmental innovations. Economic instruments  (e.g. pollution taxes and charges, tradable permits, deposit refund schemes) can stimulate more cost-saving approaches to environmental improvement by allowing flexibility in the innovative response of firms, and they create incentives for continued innovative activity to enhance eco-efficiency in the long term. Despite a number of virtues of market-based instruments, their application has been limited, and their real effect on innovation is difficult to assess because of the lack of data and because they are often used as complements to more traditional regulatory instruments. The effectiveness of market-based instruments also depends on the environmental issue to be addressed and needs to be assessed from the viewpoint of stimulating innovation. Addressing market failure for environmental innovation clearly presents an area where environmental and innovation policies need to work together and be combined in a coherent framework. Future  regulatory  regimes need  to  stimulate  participatory  approaches  (both  inter-firm  and  public andprivate) to policy design and implementation to address consumption related environmental issues such as waste management. (ii) New innovation policy approaches to address systemic failure. Innovations for environmental sustainability are also not only subject to under-investment in their development and diffusion, but also face inadequacies in the research and development system. In order to correct such systemic failure, policy designs need to address the increasingly complex, inter-disciplinary and global nature of the current environmental issues. This calls for new approaches that encourage co-operation across sectors. This should include also, clustering and networking among relevant organisations and groups in government, universities and industry in research and development and technology diffusion. Voluntary agreements provide policy alternatives for those problems that present complex organisational challenges. Partnership approaches are effective in leveraging appropriate investments in developing and diffusing environmental innovations. (iii) Formation of innovative clusters. As environmental innovations shift from end-of-pipe solutions to cleaner technologies, the environmental goods and services sector will need to adapt and restructure. In the restructured sector, specialised chabadu chabados in ICT and biotechnology or other advanced technology are  likely to have a greater role and innovative industrial clusters can arise. Innovation policy has a role to play in fostering such innovative clusters. (iv) Focused foresight. Results of recent foresight exercises in the OECD area show that environmental innovations are likely to make greater use of emergent technologies in a broad spectrum of environmental applications, but face a lack of demand in the immediate future. The development and commercialisation of environmental innovations will benefit from focused foresight exercises that actively involve the research base and the market to match supply and demand of environmental innovations. (v) Policy integration and coherence. These innovation policy instruments need to be adapted to ensure optimum investments in innovation for environmental sustainability. Such tools need to be combined and adapted to the specific needs of the sectors and the generic technologies in which policy action is appropriate.	economic growth *** environmental policy *** environmental innovations *** environmental performance *** policy implementation *** policy measures *** development and diffusion *** environmental policy *** environmental performance *** stimulating innovation *** environmental policy *** systemic failures *** environmental innovations *** diffusion of innovation *** stimulating innovation *** environmental sustainability *** environmental innovations *** market failures *** economic instruments *** innovation activities *** stimulating innovation *** environmental innovations *** market failures *** systemic failures *** policy approaches *** development and diffusion *** environmental sustainability *** systemic failures *** technology diffusion *** environmental innovations *** environmental innovations *** services sector *** small and medium sized firms *** environmental innovations *** foresight exercises *** research base *** environmental innovations *** foresight exercises *** innovation investments *** policy instruments *** environmental sustainability	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_services *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)15	BOLOGNA CONFERENCE 2000: ENHANCING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF chabadu chabados IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY: STRATEGIES AND POLICIES	1999	W2	All governments today recognise the importance of chabadu chabados and their contribution to economic growth, social cohesion, employment, regional and local development. Globalisation and technological change bring new opportunities for chabadu chabados to enter foreign markets and to reduce business costs, but there are also transition costs, new competitive challenges and risks.  In this context, groups of firms organised  in clusters or industrial districts (such as the Italian industrial districts) can play an important role in helping chabadu chabados to globalise and compete successfully at the international level while continuing to exploit their local strengths.  The aim of the conference, which will take place at the Palazzo Re Enzo in the historical centre  of Bologna, is to: Increase the understanding of issues and policies related to chabadu chabados competitiveness in the global economy. Analyse the challenges and opportunities, identify best practices, and develop policy recommendations in areas deemed important for enhancing chabadu chabados competitiveness, and foster their globalisation. The main areas are: innovation, electronic commerce, partnerships, territorial/local clusters and industrial districts. Important cross-cutting themes will be covered, e.g. funding for chabadu chabados globalisation, regulation and administrative compliance, job creation, etc. Discuss the specific issues and challenges faced by chabadu chabados in emerging and transition economies (and to some extent developing countries, including in the Mediterranean region) in the context of globalisation, and develop policy recommendations. Agree on policy initiatives through which globalisation of chabadu chabados may be facilitated. Specific issues to be discussed: What are the most important framework conditions that influence chabadu chabados incentives and capacities to innovate? What are the financial barriers to innovation for different types of chabadu chabados? What are the best practices in government support to the development of venture capital, including business angels financing and seed capital? Is financial support to Research and Development and innovation (through tax incentives or grants) efficient for all types of chabadu chabados, including micro firms? If not, which other measures are warranted to correct market failures that affect the financing of investment in innovation, including in training and organisational change? To what extent and how should government be involved in helping chabadu chabados raise their innovation management capabilities? How can government promote a wider diffusion among chabadu chabados of best practice innovation management and benchmarking tools? Are specific actions needed to help chabadu chabados better use those knowledge management tools that have a special importance in coping with globalisation, such are INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs? How can one improve the linkages between chabadu chabados and the public research sector? What barriers impair technical cross-border co-operation among chabadu chabados? How best can government promote the internationalisation of national or regional innovation networks? The conclusions from the Conference will be presented in a policy document entitled The Bologna Charter. This Charter will be a ministerial declaration on how best to foster chabadu chabados competitiveness and globalisation to the benefit of all countries. It will contain policy recommendations and suggested concrete initiatives, including those proposed by the four conference workshops and the Business Symposium. It is being prepared well in advance of the Conference and will be submitted to Member countries for comments, at different stages, through the various OECD bodies involved in the preparation of the Conference.	small and medium sized firms *** economic growth *** technological change *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** international level *** global economy *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** best practices *** job creation *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** framework conditions *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** venture capital *** best practices *** business angels *** tax incentives *** small and medium sized firms *** innovation investments *** market failures *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** best practices *** small and medium sized firms *** intellectual property *** small and medium sized firms *** public research sector *** small and medium sized firms *** small and medium sized firms *** global economy *** small and medium sized firms	firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)2	BACKGROUND REPORT ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LABOUR MARKETS	1999	R	1. In the knowledge-based economy, scientific and technological (Science and Technology) personnel play a key role in innovation and growth. Innovation surveys in several OECD countries show that highly skilled personnel are critical for innovation and economic performance at the firm level, especially in knowledge intensive service sectors. Furthermore, the mobility of Science and Technology personnel is a main channel for knowledge flows, especially tacit knowledge, in national innovation systems. This reports sheds light on some the transformations occurring in the labour market for Science and Technology personnel and identifies problems that could impede the innovative capacity of medium to longer-term ability of firms  especially chabadu chabados which play a growing role in the employment and training of Science and Technology personnel  and the public research sector.  Science and technology personnel form an estimated 20 to 30% of the labour force. Strong growth in Science and Technology employment in the business sectors, especially in high tech manufacturing and service sectors, has been coupled with a reduction in the share in public employment.  Rapidly changing skill requirements and market demand have increased the need for greater flexibility, which is manifest in the growing reliance on temporary technical staff.  Shortages for information technology (IT) workers may be a sign that supply systems are not responding with the right technical and non-technical skills for the knowledge economy.  Indeed, there is evidence that Science and Technology graduates especially at the PhD level have problems entering the labour market due in part to changing skill requirements and fewer public jobs.  The share of university graduates in science and technology also appears to be decreasing or stagnating even if total numbers have risen, which may signal declining interest in Science and Technology.  Studies of personnel mobility indicate that movement of Science and Technology personnel between public and private sectors in many OECD countries, especially at the PhD is level is limited.  Women remain underrepresented among graduates in science and technology but also in employment  even if there are signs the gaps in education and employment are decreasing.  International flows of Science and Technology students and personnel provide a supplementary source of qualified personnel and facilitate international co-operation but they cannot replace national efforts to train future generations of science and technology personnel. 2. Among the implications of these developments is that higher education institutions, while the main providers of Science and Technology education, no longer hold a monopoly position in the provision of skills for the knowledge-based economy. At the same time, formal Science and Technology qualifications are in themselves no guarantee of successful and quick integration into the knowledge-based economy, they must be complimented with on the job training and life-long learning. Workshop Experts and Delegates may want to address the following issues: n What should be the role for innovation and technology policy in improving the match between supply and demand for Science and Technology personnel? n How can barriers to employment and mobility of Science and Technology staff be reduced? n What is the scope for demand-led Public Private Partnerships for developing the right Science and Technology skills for the knowledge economy?	innovation and growth *** knowledge-based economy *** knowledge intensive services *** services sector *** knowledge flows *** tacit knowledge *** science and technology personnel *** national innovation systems *** small and medium sized firms *** public research sector *** innovation capacity *** science and technology personnel *** labour market *** science and technology personnel *** business sector *** services sector *** knowledge economy *** information technology *** labour market *** private sector *** personnel mobility *** science and technology personnel *** international co-operation *** science and technology personnel *** higher education institutions *** knowledge-based economy *** knowledge-based economy *** science and technology personnel *** public private partnerships *** knowledge economy *** labour market	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_human_resources *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_human_resources *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_human_resources *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_human_resources *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_human_resources
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)2/FINAL	MOBILISING HUMAN RESOURCES FOR INNOVATION: PROCEEDINGS FROM THE OECD WORKSHOP ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LABOUR MARKETS	1999	W2	The move towards the knowledge-based economy has placed human resources in science and technology  at the forefront of policy debate. In 1998, the TIP Group undertook analyses of science and technology labour markets, following earlier work by the former Group on the Science System and statistical work by the NESTI. The work responded to a finding by the OECDs 1998 report on Technology, Productivity and Job Creation: Best Policy Practices, that technical progress is increasing demand for skilled labour and spurring an upgrading of skills across economies. This increase in demand is not being met equally in OECD countries; surpluses and shortages for certain types of Science and Technology personnel point to slow adjustment of supply and labour market rigidities such as lack of flexibility and barriers to labour mobility. A waning interest in Science and Technology among youth, under-representation of women in Science and Technology education and employment, and the globalisation of the highly-skilled labour force pose other challenges to the ability of OECD countries to provide the right Science and Technology skills for the knowledge-based economy. In conjunction with its recent meeting in May 1999, the TIP Group held a Thematic Workshop on Science and Technology Labour Markets: Current Trends and Challenges. This executive summary reviews the main results and policy issues raised in the context of the TIP work on human resources in science and technology and the thematic workshop on Science and Technology labour markets. What is the role of Science and Technology workers in the economy? Human resources in science and technology are important for several reasons. First, investment in human capital is key to innovation and growth. As both the producers and users of knowledge and technology, men and women in science and technology are at the core of the technology-led economic expansion that is creating jobs and raising living standards in several OECD countries. Educated Science and Technology workers are among the key services that the public sector provides to the private sector. The public benefits of spillovers generated by human capital are an important reason for governments to invest in public education and research training. As basic research becomes more important for technology and innovation, continued investment in Science and Technology personnel is critical for exploiting the benefits of public research. The long-term sustainability of science and the innovation process will depend on an adequate and well-trained supply of new researchers and teachers as many older researchers and professors are about to leave the workforce. Second, firm level evidence indicates that the share of Science and Technology workers in firms, irrespective of firm size and sector, has an impact on the introduction of new products and processes. Science and Technology personnel help firms appropriate and apply the knowledge from basic research into industrial applications and solve complex technological problems but also raise the overall learning capacity of firms. Science and Technology personnel thus constitute a stock of intangible capital to the firm, as much of the returns to investment in innovation are only partially secured by the generation of new products, patents or other intellectual property rights.Third, the movement of science and technology personnel between sectors, large and small firms, and across national borders is an important conduit for technology transfer. The skills developed by graduates in Science and Technology provide substantial economic benefits to society as graduates move on carrying with them both codified and tacit knowledge. This knowledge is especially important in newly emerging and fast-moving areas of science and technology. In addition, co-operation in research and technology largely takes place through people; scientists and researchers have long participated in national and international networks of experts. Barriers to mobility and co-operation could thus significantly weaken innovative capacity in OECD countries. Fourth, mismatches in supply and demand for Science and Technology personnel can have repercussions on the broader economy; shortages for information technology (IT) workers for example could result in wage pressure. Labour market imbalances for Science and Technology personnel may thus contribute to unemployment, and an international brain drain. Finally, human resources in science and technology are important because they constitute a source of entrepreneurs. Increasingly, academics and Science and Technology graduates start up firms or participate in the creation of company spin-offs from the public research sector, thereby contributing to innovation, knowledge and technology transfer, industrial restructuring and job creation. Indeed, new technology-based firms are a growing source of jobs for the highly skilled as illustrated by evidence on employment growth of Science and Technology personnel in chabadu chabados. Weak incentives for self-employment and firm creation could suppress this entrepreneurial potential, however. Main policy challenges. At their Ministerial meeting in June 1999, CSTP Ministers concluded that sufficient  personnel mobility and better information flows in the economy are essential to meet the needs of the 21st century for highly skilled personnel. In doing so, Ministers recognised that science, technology and innovation policies have a role in both the generation of Science and Technology skills and their deployment in the private and public sectors. Making Science and Technology education and training policies more responsive to changing demand. As technology increases demand for Science and Technology workers, governments and businesses must find new ways to provide workers with the skills for the knowledge economy. An increase in temporary employment, the growing importance of IT skills, enhanced university-industry co-operation and the globalisation of skilled workers all mean that the conditions underlying the supply and demand for Science and Technology workers have changed. In the new model of innovation, scientists and researchers can no longer be trained to work in laboratories isolated from societal and economic prerogatives. Education and training policies have long focused on increasing the supply of higher education. Given the long lead times in supply and changing demand, this appears increasingly inadequate. Enhancing the quality of Science and Technology education in order to improve the skills match between supply and demand and sustain the research enterprise is becoming equally, if not more, important. The debate on skills shortages also reveals that higher education can no longer be viewed as the exclusive source for Science and Technology skills, especially IT. Industry and trade associations have a role to play as secondary education institutions. Duration of higher education is also an issue in several countries as long programmes can prevent early or easy exit from education to employment, increase lead times in supply, and result in skill mismatches. Interdisciplinarity in education and research is becoming more important in both the public and private sectors but the Science and Technology curriculum and training systems are slow to adjust. This is especially the case at PhD level where programmes are highly specialised. At the same time, interdisciplinarity leads to the  emergence of new specialised disciplines so education policies must balance both specialisation and interdisciplinarity. The diffusion of IT and its application in Science and Technology education and research (especially in  new fields such as bio-informatics) means that Science and Technology and non-Science and Technology workers alike must increasingly be IT literate. Furthermore, since non-technical skills are also of growing importance, the curriculum should be broadened to build interpersonal and networking skills, and expose Science and Technology students to business and entrepreneurial skills. Part of the solution to problems of skills shortages can be found in alternative sources of supply; non-Science and Technology workers, older workers and women (who are under-represented in science and engineering fields) are a potential source. But improving the gender balance in Science and Technology will require complementary efforts in  education at the primary and secondary levels and in public and private research employment. This is particularly important in the IT field where employment and education tend to be male dominated in most OECD countries. The experience of some types of Science and Technology graduates in finding employment suggests that formal Science and Technology qualifications are no guarantee for a successful and quick integration into the knowledge-based economy. They must be complemented with on-the-job training and lifelong learning. Lifelong learning measures should actively integrate science and technology, especially IT skills. This is becoming more important as technological change requires a continuous upgrading of skills. Consequently, governments and firms have a stake in ensuring that workers, including the highly skilled, have incentives to invest in new skills. Governments can provide incentives for lifelong learning to firms and workers in the form of tax incentives and cost-sharing arrangements. Public partnerships between firms, government, and educational institutions can help address the issue of the risks and costs of training; chabadu chabados are particularly vulnerable to such risks as few have resources to train workers and, under a tight labour market, may have even less incentive to do so. One of the problems firms and education systems face in meeting skill requirements and training needs is lack of information on technological, industrial and research developments. Technology foresight exercises can complement occupational forecasts by creating a process that brings together firms, education planners and the research community to exchange information and identify potential new skill demands. Adapting the science system to new demands. Despite the growth in employment of Science and Technology personnel in the business sector, government and institutions  for higher education remain key employers of Science and Technology personnel. Science and education remain among the core tasks of government even in economies where the public sector is leaning more to the market. It is  thus incumbent upon governments to ensure that there are incentive structures to attract, train and retain Science and Technology personnel who will teach new generations of students and contribute to basic research that would not otherwise be carried out by the business sector. In the past, public research employment was characterised by secure employment provisions and low employment turnover as well as concentrated age structures towards older workers. But increasing returns from public research requires greater openness and renewal of the public research enterprise. Universities and public research institutes, like firms, increasingly require the flexibility of temporary employment to access specific expertise from outside especially in the context of participation in research and technology partnerships with industry (e.g. contract research). Already, in some countries some of the basic characteristics of public sector employment, such as tenure systems and permanent employment, are giving way to more flexible arrangements. Many public science institutes have been privatised or have spun-off activities for commercial purposes and this is affecting employment relations, research prerogatives and skills. These developments raise new challenges. The special tenure and pension arrangements in universities and public laboratories may act as disincentives to mobility. At the same time, tenure has been promoted as a way to reward academic achievement and allow scientists independence in research. Consequently, other incentives, including sharing in the commercial returns of public research and possibilities for academic entrepreneurship, must be constructed if researchers are to continue to pursue research and teaching in the public sector. As intermediaries between researchers and public employers, public employee unions and professional associations have an important role to play in the new employment arrangements and incentives structures that are emerging. Leveraging human resources in Science and Technology to enhance science and industry relationships. Innovation in firms and advances in science increasingly depend on the intensity and quality of interactions between the public research base (government laboratories and university research) and the business  sector. Across OECD countries and at national and regional levels, policies have been implemented to commercialise public research. This does not happen automatically and human resources are an integral part of technology transfer and commercialisation strategies. Policies that aim to enhance industry-research interactions therefore often focus on improving mobility of Science and Technology workers. Mobility not only benefits firms and universities, but can benefit researchers themselves in terms of increasing human capital and building personal and research networks. There are concerns in many OECD countries that barriers to researcher mobility can weaken the pace of scientific discovery and innovation. Preliminary results from the OECDs work on Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships suggests that regulatory barriers are generally low in most OECD countries but that non-regulatory barriers and weak incentive systems restrict mobility of public sector researchers. But while mobility is important, too much mobility may have longer-term repercussions on both demand and supply for Science and Technology labour. Frequent job changes involve a loss of job-specific skills and transaction costs for workers and employers. Higher turnover could act as a disincentive for training of Science and Technology workers. Mobility is also skewed towards younger researchers as the propensity to change jobs, or sectors decreases with age. Reforms in the science system that allow academics to co-operate with industry in the framework of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS can enhance mobility and flows of tacit knowledge. These may include improving the portability of public sector pensions, allowing public researchers to advance their careers while working for industry or better recognizing joint publication with industry. Financial incentives that reward mobility and co-operation with industry such as INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT sharing and equity participation in spin-offs can also improve knowledge flows and provide practical training. Yet universities are increasingly concerned that greater industry involvement, including mobility of researchers, may redirect their mission away from fundamental research and teaching. If academics engage in industrial projects or firms, there is less time for teaching and basic research. But the two may be reconciled if academics with practical experience continue to teach and prepare students for industrial and public research. Moreover, networking and inter-firm collaboration may complement or substitute for external mobility and may actually be preferable from the knowledge perspective. The policy implication is that while internal and external mobility should be encouraged through the removal of regulatory and non-regulatory barriers, alternatives to physical mobility such as networking and  virtual mobility should also be explored. Enhancing framework conditions for the business sector to strengthen the contribution of Science and Technology personnel to innovation. Framework conditions in the business sector play an important role in providing incentives for students to pursue education in science and technology in the first place, and once in the labour market, in moderating the match between supply and demand. In the face of changing demand for skills or in the event of shortages, limited flexibility in wage-setting arrangements may reduce incentives for Science and Technology workers and may lead to increased international mobility. The OECD Jobs Study outlined reforms in the areas of wage flexibility and overall labour mobility which can aid firms and workers to better respond to technology- induced changes in labour market demand. These broader labour market reforms are often essential in meeting the more narrow demand for Science and Technology personnel. Framework conditions can influence the investment by firms in hiring and training skilled workers. Organisations and workers have a greater incentive to invest in training if employment relations are relatively stable and predictable. Because higher education and training, especially in Science and Technology, has significant private benefits, firms and individuals may have to absorb a larger part of costs. This requires clear market signals for both workers and firms to invest in training. But market failures may prevent firms, especially chabadu chabados, from hiring and training research and technical personnel. Science and Technology policies may thus have an  additional role in encouraging human capital and training investments in small firms. Without business conditions that facilitate the creation of business start-ups, the contribution of investment in science and technology to innovation and growth will remain limited. New technology-based firms are significant employers of Science and Technology personnel and key actors in the innovation process. At the general level these conditions include well-functioning venture capital markets, regulatory reform to enable greater entry and exit (business start-ups and closures) and, more broadly, a business climate that rewards risk and new undertakings. If incentives for self-employment and firm creation are weak, this could lead to weak or depressed demand for Science and Technology personnel. Finally, the degree of openness in the economy also matters and policies towards the permanent and temporary immigration of foreign high skilled workers play a role in helping the business sector adjust to demand shocks. From the workshop discussions, it emerged that countries whose higher education and research systems are internationalised in general succeed better in increasing the pool of foreign Science and Technology workers. Yet countries would be shortsighted to rely too much on foreign Science and Technology students and personnel as a source of additional supply as it no substitute for national efforts to train future generations of scientists and technology personnel. Concluding remarks and further work. The move towards the knowledge-based economy is characterised by increasing demand but also changes in the types of skills and qualifications required. The expansion of IT across economic sectors, including services, will continue to fuel the demand for Science and Technology workers. On the supply side, there have been dramatic increases in the number of higher education graduates, especially in catching-up countries, but there are signs that the share of Science and Technology graduates may be falling or stagnating in some countries. Some categories of Science and Technology graduates are having trouble entering the labour market as they lack the right skills even whilst industry reports shortages for Science and Technology personnel in knowledge intensive sectors. The slowness of supply systems to adjust means that partnerships between government, industry and education providers are necessary to speed the labour market entry. The OECD's work on Science and Technology labour markets and the presentations at the TIP Group Workshop underscore the important role that science, technology and innovation policies have in improving the match between supply and demand and enhancing the contribution of Science and Technology personnel to scientific discovery, innovation and economic performance. Policies to promote Science and Technology education and training must focus more on quality issues. Information technology skills should be integrated at all levels of education and lifelong learning. A number of countries such as Finland, the United States, Ireland and Denmark are taking the lead in investing in IT education to address potential shortages. Technology foresight policies can also help business and governments identify growth areas in science and technology that may have implications on skills demand and education. Because a large share of Science and Technology personnel are trained and work in the public sector, technology and innovation policies must ensure the science system can attract and retain researchers. This will require adapting the regulatory framework in the public research sector to the new employment demands for flexibility, mobility and growing university-industry interactions. While reducing barriers to mobility, especially non-regulatory barriers, remains an important challenge in many countries, the presentation by Miles and Tomlinson highlights the limits to and the costs of mobility as well as the importance of fostering alternatives to physical mobility for technology transfer and co-operation. Education and employment policies in research should capitalise on industry-science relationships by adjusting curricula and rules so that staff with industry experience can contribute to teaching and research. Capturing the teaching and public research benefits from industry-science interactions will also require adjustments to incentives systems. One way is to improve the rewards to academics from participating in industrial projects (e.g. through incentives for joint publications, sharing the rewards in joint patenting). Financing of higher education research can also be a mechanism for strengthening teaching and research missions in areas of importance to industry and society. Governments play a key role in developing the framework conditions for the business sector but also the specific policies in the science system that encourage the entrepreneurial potential of Science and Technology personnel. In other words, policy cannot only focus on supply but must address market failures on the demand side as well. Improving the mechanisms for research commercialisation and conditions for company spin-offs and business start-ups is necessary for generating new demand for Science and Technology personnel, especially in chabadu chabados, and enhancing their contribution to innovation and growth. Data issues, including problems in classifying Science and Technology workers, continue to limit analysis. The TIP workshop highlighted the potential for better exploitation and use of national data. Although most data are not gathered with the specific objective of analysing human resources in Science and Technology, they provide a  powerful political tool. In many cases, as illustrated in the Spanish presentation by Canibano and Sanchez, only minor modifications to the existing questionnaires could enormously improve the analytical capacity of the data. Focusing on specific issues and groups might yield more results than attempting to measure stocks and flows of the entire Science and Technology population. The importance of maintaining flexibility in taxonomies and data collection was also stressed at the workshop. Statistical agencies and policy makers must recognise the diversity within Science and Technology human resources. The relationship between educational qualifications and occupation is often quite loose. In addition, there are many barriers to substitution; a specialist in molecular biology is not easily replaced by a chemical engineer. As we move into the 21st century, addressing the issues above is of vital importance to innovation and the economic competitiveness of OECD economies. While OECD countries have succeeded in raising education attainment levels, especially in science and technology, the knowledge-based economy is exerting new demands for flexibility in the education and employment of human resources in Science and Technology. In the near future, other developments such as the ageing of the workforce will pose additional challenges to policy makers. The OECD will follow-up its work on human resources in science and technology in the context of the work by the TIP Group on Innovation and Growth and Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships. The latter project will deepen analyses on the regulatory frameworks and policies that govern researcher employment, mobility and their interactions with industry, whether it is in the commercialisation of research or the creation of spin-off firms. The OECDs Working Party on the Information Economy will be revisiting the issue of IT workers in its Information Technology Outlook 2000. As regards further methodological and data work, the OECDs NIS Focus Group on Human Resources Mobility is continuing its work on mobility for an extended group of countries and a study of international mobility. The Group of National of Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI) is continuing work on the mobility of human resources and will prepare a final report, with statistics from France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, by the end of 1999.	knowledge-based economy *** human resources *** labour market *** science system *** job creation *** skilled labour ***

DSTI/STP/TIP(99)3	INNOVATION AND GROWTH IN THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY: PROPOSED OUTLINE	1999	S	OECD economies are confronted by change, due to globalisation, rapid technological progress and the transition to a knowledge-based economy. But how do these changes affect innovation and economic performance, and how does policy need to respond to this new environment? A transition to a knowledge-based economy would thus suggest that certain drivers of growth are more important than they were in the past. For instance, scientific research now appears to have a more direct impact on innovation, and information technology is regarded as a key determinant of productivity growth in many sectors. Innovation and growth in one OECD member country is also increasingly linked to that in others. The expansion in the global stock of knowledge permits countries to access an ever-larger knowledge base.  The paper will focus on the following questions: What are the contributions of innovation, Research and Development, human capital, information technology and other forms of knowledge to economic growth? Have these contributions increased over time? Are knowledge and innovation becoming more important for economic growth? What are the main characteristics of a knowledge-based economy? What is the impact of globalisation on these processes? What are the new ways of learning and knowledge exchange among countries? Are technology spillovers more limited than in the past? Is co-operation now more important than competition? What are the implications of growing industrial specialisation for competitiveness, competition and economic growth? What are the implications for policy? Is there a new potential for economic growth and can policy add to it? Are national and international policies sufficiently oriented towards benefiting from such a potential? Is greater investment in knowledge needed?	knowledge-based economy *** knowledge-based economy *** scientific research *** information technology *** innovation and growth *** knowledge base *** economic growth *** information technology *** economic growth *** knowledge-based economy *** economic growth *** economic growth *** knowledge-based economy *** innovation and growth	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)4	PROMOTING INNOVATION AND GROWTH IN SERVICES	1999	R	1. Services are a dynamic part of the economy. Many services experience rapid productivity growth, several are highly innovative, and new jobs in the services sector increasingly require highly skilled personnel. Services are also becoming more tradable and are increasingly exposed to competition, pressuring improvements in performance. Since services are a sufficiently dynamic part of the economy, the emergence of the services sector as the driver of economic growth and job creation is no threat to macro-economic performance, although government policies need to adjust to its growing role and impact. 2. Most of the obstacles to growth and innovation in services are no different than they are in manufacturing. Recent OECD work on innovation systems has provided a framework for policies to promote innovation that is of equal relevance to the services sector as it is for manufacturing. However, while there appears no need for a specific policy for innovation in services, some elements of innovation policy must take better account of the needs and key characteristics of the services sector. Such policies will also need to account for the enormous variety of the services sector. These policies include: ./ Ongoing reform of regulatory structures to promote competition and innovation, and to reduce barriers and administrative formalities for new entrants. ./ Reduction of trade and foreign investment barriers in services to allow greater competition and the diffusion of innovative ideas and concepts. The globalisation of services will require further efforts to strengthen the capacity of OECD economies to adjust. ./ Re-design of some instruments of innovation policy, such as the scope of Research and Development support and technology diffusion programmes, to take better account of services. ./ Appropriate regulatory reform to ease access to service-relevant ICT, e.g. high-capacity broadband communications, and to reduce costs, and sufficient attention to ICT skills and the development of knowledge-intensive business services. ./ Better and more comprehensive data on the services sector, to enhance the understanding of processes that drive service innovation. Such data should focus more on the interaction between services and manufacturing. 3. Delegates may want to focus their discussion on the following main issues: ./ In the light of the growing importance of the services sector, is innovation policy sufficiently geared towards the needs and characteristics of services sectors? Which policies are key to promoting services sector performance? ./ Are any specific policies required to promote innovation in services, or can services be readily integrated in the broader policy framework of national innovation systems? ./ What is the role of knowledge-intensive business services (KBIS) in the national innovation system? Is there a role for government in the development of an effective KBIS sector?	services sector *** job creation *** economic growth *** services sector *** innovation in services *** innovation and growth *** policy frameworks *** innovation systems *** services sector *** innovation in services *** services sector *** services sector *** foreign direct investment *** supporting research and development *** technology diffusion programmes *** regulatory reform *** service industries *** innovation in services *** services sector *** services sector *** services sector *** innovation in services *** policy frameworks *** national innovation systems *** service industries *** national innovation systems *** innovation and growth	policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)5	BENCHMARKING RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS: OUTLINE	1999	S	In a knowledge-based economy innovative firms are reliant on an ever widening range of technologies, and thus must both broaden their competencies and more frequently outsource technical and scientific expertise. The distinction between science and technology also becomes more blurred. In some high-growth new industries such as biotechnology, basic scientific research is the main source of innovation. RecIntellectual Property Rightocally, an increasing part of scientific research addresses problems identified during the course of technological development in the business sector. Recent work by the TIP Group emphasises that, as a result, innovation performance increasingly depends on the intensity and quality of interactions between the public research base (government laboratories and university research) and the business sector. The objective of the project is to provide international benchmarks to help them evaluate the performance of the research-industry interface, identify good practices concerning the  underlying  incentive structures and/or institutional arrangements, and determine the policy implications in their respective national contexts. The value added of the proposed project lies in three areas: (1) It will provide the first cross-country comparison of industry-research relationships in the OECD area; (2) It will extend the scope of previous studies by covering the industry-research relationship in its entirety, and by addressing all determinants of performance; (3) It will allow both general and country-specific policy conclusions on how to improve the industry-research relationship.Further analysis suggests the existence of three types of often mutually-reinforcing negative factors: (1) regulatory impediments; (2) strongly path dependent research agendas at many public organisations; and (3) short time horizons of private investment in innovation. However, beyond these general features, the research-industry interface exhibits a number of country-specific characteristics, especially with respect to: the relative size and composition of the public research sector, including the relative importance of basic and applied research of universities and public laboratories; the (pattern of/degree of) specialisation of mission-oriented research organisations; the regulations which influence public researchers ability and willingness to co-operate with the private sector; the percentage and types (size, technological focus) of firms most involved in transactions with the public research sector; the regional concentration of research-industry links; the degree and form of intermediation of these links; the intensity of third-party involvement (e.g. financial institutions; private service firms); and the types of government incentives and programmes meant to deepen the ties between  research in the public and private sectors. The challenge of a benchmarking study on the performance of the research-industry interface   lies in: identifying and, to the extent possible, measuring what the desired outcomes of public-private collaborations ought to be from a public policy perspective; comparing the outcomes of different configurations of the research-industry interface, including differences in performance due to regional variations in the largest countries or to technological specialisations; assessing the influence of key framework conditions (e.g. regulations) on such performance; identifying novel forms of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; developing a score board of individual countries main strengths/weaknesses; deriving policy guidelines to help individual countries determine the priority areas for government initiative, ranging from regulatory reforms which improve incentive structures to institutional reforms aimed at changing the mission of some public research organisations or intermediaries.	innovative firms *** knowledge-based economy *** scientific research *** business sector *** technology development *** scientific research *** innovation performance *** research base *** public research *** business sector *** good practices *** incentive structures *** institutional arrangements *** innovation investments *** private sector *** public research sector *** research organisations *** applied research *** private sector *** framework conditions *** regulatory reform *** public private partnerships *** research organisations *** incentive structures	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)6	HIGH TECH SPIN-OFFS: ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK	1999	R	1. Spin-offs are an important indicator of the ability of economies to commercialise research results from the public sector. Comparing the performance of different countries in creating spin-offs is rather difficult, however. There is no universal definition of a spin-off firm, and often the term is used almost interchangeably with that of start-ups or new technology based firms (NTBFs). As a result, estimates of spin-off formation are not consistently comparable across parent institutions, let alone across countries. This study aims to establish a common definition and compare across the OECD the number and rate of spin-off firm formation for countries as a whole, or for key laboratories or universities when national data is unavailable. 2. In order to derive policy recommendations with regard to the importance of spin-off firms and strategies for their promotion, this study will delineate different spin-off typologies (in terms of funding options, links to public sector, lifecycle), which may serve as models for policymakers. The study will also compare the costs and benefits of various spin-off promotional policies in order to help policymakers decide what approach is best suited to their national innovation system. 3. Finally, this study on spin-offs will make an important contribution to the theoretical framework of the TIP project on Benchmarking Research-Industry Relationships. It will reflect on how particular types of institutions - in this case spin-offs - can be used as indicators to benchmark the health of the public-private Research and Development interface. The generation of spin-offs is an important and measurable outcome of public-private collaborations, but should not be an end in itself. By clarifying what spin-offs are and what they add to the economy, one can define the unique characteristics of this technology transfer conduit which make spin-offs an integral part of a knowledge based economy and which justify their use as an indicator of a successful public-private interface. It should also help in defining what other outcomes are necessary in order to benchmark country performances.	public sector *** research results *** new technologies *** technology based firms *** spin-off formation *** public sector *** national innovation systems *** business research and development *** technology transfer	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)7	PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE THEMATIC WORKSHOPS 1999-2000	1999	M	Only 2 new thematic workshops are proposed: (1) Innovation and Environmental Sustainability : There has been a series of studies by the TIP Group on related issues in this area, all of which point to the key role innovation policies play in improving environmental performance. The workshop could identify elements of effective innovation policy for strengthening the market pull for environmental innovations through examining case studies of sectoral applications of various policy tools ,and The role of some generic technologies, such as information and communication technology, biotechnology or nano- or micro-scale technology in improving environmental performance. The workshop would also explore ways to better integrate innovation policy with other policies and instruments (environmental, regulatory, fiscal and economic) in a coherent framework.  (2) High Tech Spin-Offs : Its aim is to explore the importance of public sector spin-offs as a mechanism of technology transfer and the effectiveness of policies to promote their development. This workshop will first compare the generation of spin-offs across OECD countries, and describe what is known about the structure and lifecycle of spin-off firms. Second, the workshop will discuss what accounts for the wide disparity across OECD countries in the generation of spin-offs. Third, the effectiveness of policies designed to promote spin-off development will be discussed, with a view toward evaluating the relative costs of various policies in light of the potential economic impact of spin-offs. Finally, the workshop could discuss how to benchmark country performances using spin-offs as a measure of science-industry outcomes.	environmental sustainability *** environmental performance *** environmental innovations *** environmental performance *** policy profiles *** public sector *** technology transfer	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)8/FINAL	TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: PROCEEDINGS OF THE BUDAPEST WORKSHOP	1999	W2	As a part of the activities of the Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy, a workshop was held in Budapest on 11 December 1998, under the joint sponsorship of the Hungarian National Committee for Technological Development (OMFB) and the OECD, on Technology Foresight for Sustainable Development, with the participation of experts and officials from more than a dozen OECD Member countries. This document includes the nine papers presented at the workshop. The papers discuss issues surrounding foresight methodology for environmental sustainability, results of some recent foresight studies including key future technologies for sustainable development, and policy relevance and implementation of foresight results as they relate to achieving environmental objectives. There is  a growing interest in technology foresight in the OECD Member countries for priority setting in research and for directing research and development efforts to be more responsive to future needs. Sustainable development is a future need along with enhancing growth, competitiveness, and job creation, to which Governments of OECD Member countries attach increasing importance. Technology foresight is a tool that can be used to match emerging technologies with future needs. The papers present useful insights into the nature of technologies relevant for the environment, problems of foresight methodology for environmental objectives, and issues in policy relevance and implementation of the results. One clear trend that emerges from the papers is that the nature of the technologies that contribute to improved environmental performance has evolved over the last few decades. Some of the papers (Johnsen, Calenbuhr) refer to the narrow meaning of end-of-pipe technologies when using the term, environmental technology and point to their limited contribution to enhancing competitiveness while improving environmental performance. They stress the importance of a broader definition that includes process and product integrated cleaner, and more resource efficient technologies. Such a broader definition is used by the other authors when using the term environmental technology, and the recent shifts to such cleaner and resource efficient technologies are proving to contribute to the improvement, not only of environmental performance, but also economic performance, through cost saving and enhancing competitiveness and productivity growth of firms that develop and use them. Awareness is growing that innovations for environmental sustainability present an enormous area of business opportunities; hence, economic growth and job creation. Such a change in the nature of environmental technologies makes them even more diffuse, as some authors stress (Kuntze, Fukasaku, Williams). Technologies that enhance environmental performance and sustainability are found in all established disciplinary areas and are applied in all industrial and infrastructure sectors. They are basically bound by their common objective of improving environmental sustainability. The diffuseness of technologies relevant for environmental sustainability points to the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in research and development, closer links between  government, industry and universities not only in research but also in the application of some technologies. As Vollenbroek et al. suggest, technologies that enhance environmental sustainability work best when applied not as separate technologies but as technology systems. The interdisciplinary and intersectoral nature of environmental technologies point also to the importance of international co-operation in developing relevant technologies, as these papers stress. This is especially important when addressing global environmental issues. Another point about technologies relevant for sustainability is that such technologies extend beyond technologies that produce or are embodied in tangible goods. Some papers point to the importance of organisational or soft innovations (Kuntze, Williams), and Calenbuhr cites examples of the sale of goods being replaced by services. This articulation of market demand for services provided by manufactured goods, rather than their ownership, has profound implications for environmental sustainability. Calenbuhr also gives examples of financial sector innovations that can have positive effects in inducing investments  in environmental technologies. This points to the importance of an integrated approach not only for technologies in the industrial process, but also in designing policies to stimulate innovation in environmentally sustainable technologies. The integrated approach implies policy integration and coherence between research and technology policy on the one hand, and a number of other policy areas including environment, regulatory, fiscal and economic policies for the aim of improving environmental sustainability on the other. In view of such a broad scope of technologies relevant for the environment, it is quite striking that the attempts at identifying some key future technologies for environmental amelioration discussed in some papers, (Kuntze, Stokes, Fukasaku, Williams) demonstrate remarkable convergence, despite the difference in the foresight methodologies on which such analyses are based. This implies that there is a consensus at the international level on the generic technologies and broad application areas that will serve the needs of sustainable development. The generic technology areas include information and communication technology, biotechnology, nano- and micro-scale technologies, and advanced materials. The application areas range from agriculture, water treatment, waste and hazardous substance treatment and management, vehicle technology, construction, cleaner industrial processes, and energy, to monitoring and counteracting global environmental changes. Despite this remarkable agreement on the kinds of technologies that can be supplied for sustainable development objectives, most papers express extreme uncertainty about the prospects for realisation of such technologies on a significant scale. This is reflected in the recourse to scenario approach in assessing the extent of the market demand and the penetration of such environmentally sustainable technologies (Havas et al.; Dearing, Vollenbroek, et al.). This demonstrates that the extent of use of environmental technologies depends overwhelmingly on the kind of socio-economic system that will be in place in the future. The possible future scenarios of socio-economic evolution discussed in the papers differ considerably at first glance, but are all stereo-typical in a sense. The real world is likely to consist of a mixture of conflicting values and socio-economic trends rather than stereo-typical systems that scenarios tend to depict. In general, however, the scenarios discussed in the papers indicate that socio-economic systems that focus simply on more growth are likely to fail to implement environmental technologies and lead to an unsustainable future, and those that favour regional integration and co-prosperity between the regions of the world, while allowing pluralistic values and equitable growth, are likely to provide a larger market for environmental technologies, hence improving our chances to achieve a sustainable future. Thus, the bottleneck for environmentally sustainable technological innovations, the authors agree, lies not in their supply, but in the lack of a market for them. This market pull factor is of utmost importance. Dearing goes as far as to say that innovation is no use when there is no market for it, because the market for environmental innovations, as it stands now, is still so precarious and inarticulate. Strengthening of the market pull is where public innovation policy can play a vital role. Here again, the importance of policy integration and coherence is underlined. As Vollenbroek et al. suggest, a high level of  economic  dynamism is necessary for achieving sustainable development, but this needs to be combined with articulated societal demand for environmentally efficient technology systems. This brings us back to foresight methodology. Given current trends in general, and especially  with foresight for sustainable development, the integration of market orientation seems to be a crucial component of foresight exercises. This is the part that the UK Foresight Programme attempted to integrate and reinforce. As Williams says, identifying future technologies was less important compared to the foresight process of bringing together the research base and the industry to consider together the opportunities and challenges for marketable innovations. The importance of foresight was in the process not in the prediction. Through this interactive process, proactive matching of supplies of technology with societal demand can be done. The importance of an interactive process was stressed in the foresight exercises of smaller countries. As pointed out by Johnsen, the research base of smaller countries is often too small to design and implement foresight exercises such as the Delphi survey. In launching the new Norwegian Environment and Technology 2010 programme, the results of larger countries foresight studies were used to identify future technologies, and within the country, the foresight exercises focuses on generating interactive process involving government, research base, industry and societal groups. Similarly, the Dutch programme likewise drew upon the results of other foresight studies to identify technology options for sustainable development. The Hungarian foresight programme is designed to generate an interactive process for identifying research priorities in that countrys relatively new socio-economic system, which is now also aspiring for integration into a newer regional socio-economic framework of the European Union: this is likely to give the country a more promising path to sustainable future. To be sure, there now exists a large pool of foresight studies made by larger countries (Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, France) upon which other countries, especially newly industrialising ones, could draw. As the papers in this document demonstrate, the value of technology foresight as a tool, therefore, is in its ability as a process to link the public research sector with industry in the substantive discussion of a desirable future and of marketable technologies. It is a tool that can identify and match technology supply with market demand, including demand for social objectives. When the foresight process is designed so that market opportunities are fully taken into account, it could make valuable contributions to realising sustainable development at the same time as dynamic growth and job creation.	foresight exercises *** technology development *** sustainable development *** environmental sustainability *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises *** priority setting *** job creation *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises *** environmental performance *** environmental technologies *** environmental performance *** environmental technologies *** environmental performance *** economic growth *** job creation *** environmental sustainability *** environmental technologies *** environmental performance *** environmental sustainability *** environmental sustainability *** environmental sustainability *** international co-operation *** environmental technologies *** environmental sustainability *** environmental technologies *** policy areas *** environmental sustainability *** international level *** sustainable development *** sustainable development *** environmental technologies *** environmental technologies *** environmental innovations *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises *** sustainable development *** research base *** foresight exercises *** research base *** foresight exercises *** research base *** foresight exercises *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises *** public research sector *** job creation *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises *** sustainable development	policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP(99)9	BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY-SCIENCE RELATIONSHIPS RESULTS OF THE BENCHMARKING QUESTIONNAIRE	1999	S	In the scoping phase, the Secretariat develops the benchmarking framework and takes stock of existing information, partly through a questionnaire to Delegations in order to gather information on (1) regulatory aspects of the industry- science relationships, and (2) research-based spin-offs. This document provides a preliminary synthesis of the answers to this questionnaire. The Group is invited to discuss this document with a view to provide guidance for follow-up work based on the following Secretariat suggestions that take into account the recent discussion on the project within the CSTP: Part A On regulatory aspects, further work could aim to: (i) Complete and make more accurate the overall picture of the regulatory environment of industry- science relationships in the different Member countries. This could be achieved through bilateral contacts between the Secretariat and contact points in Member countries. (ii) Deepen the analysis for selected issues where the OECD project is likely to have the greatest value-added for policy makers. There are two good topic candidates: A review of the way in which researchers at public institutions are evaluated and rewarded, with an emphasis on mechanisms that better take into account their contribution to public/private research co-operation. A study of the best approaches and tools in order to facilitate access by chabadu chabados to public research. In both cases, the Secretariat would send a call for proposals to Delegations, in order to identify promising policy approaches, and would subsequently work closely with relevant Delegations to document and extract the best practices of selected cases. Part B On spin-offs, further work could focus on: (i) Developing proxy data on spin-off formation rates across respondent countries in order to get a more accurate sense of comparative country capabilities. This data will be built up from institution-specific spin-off formation rates in the majority of OECD countries, with an effort to compare: (1) the total number of spin-offs in existence, and (2) the number of spin-offs formed per year. (ii) The role of the public sector in providing financial support to spin-offs, based on country case studies of spin-off financial structures and lifecycles.	business research and development *** research organisations *** public research *** small and medium sized firms *** policy approaches *** best practices *** spin-off formation *** spin-off formation *** public sector *** industry-science relationships	policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2000)1	WORKSHOP ON INNOVATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT	2000	W1	Objectives: The aim of this workshop is to examine the role of environmental policy in stimulating environmental innovation and of innovation policy in enhancing environmental performance for sustainable economic growth and development. Presently, because of market and systemic failures, private investment in environmental Research and Development and innovation is sub-optimal to address the longer-term costs of environmental degradation and reduce the gap between positive externalities related to innovation diffusion and negative externalities associated with economic growth. Public policy needs to play a key role in addressing these failures, and the emerging knowledge-based economy offers new ways of correcting them to make innovation contribute to environmentally sustainable development. Environment and innovation policy areas need to reinforce each other to reap the potential benefits that innovation can make to environmental sustainability. The first session will explore ways of designing environmental policy that stimulate innovation. Focus will be on ways of integrating economic instruments. The second session will examine innovation policy approaches that could better stimulate environmental innovation.  These sessions will be followed by a panel discussion that will explore ways  for better integration and coherence between environment and innovation policies. This workshop will contribute to the final report of the OECD horizontal programme on sustainable development, and is organised in co-operation with the Environment Directorate. Presentations are: : Technology Effects of Environmental Policy - An overview of the effects of past policies and suggestions for improvement, Economic Instruments in Practice: Carbon Tax in Sweden, Economic Instruments in Practice: Tradable Sulphur Dioxide Emission Permits in the US Electricity Sector; The Effectiveness of Voluntary Agreements: The Results of the Second Follow-up to the Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan on the Environment (Global Warming Measures); Sustainable Innovation: Drivers and Barriers; Beyond the Double Dividend: Public and Private Roles in the Transformation to a Sustainable Industrial Society; Environmental Cluster Programme.	environmental innovations *** environmental performance *** economic growth *** environmental policy *** systemic failures *** diffusion of innovation *** economic growth *** sustainable development *** knowledge-based economy *** environmental sustainability *** policy areas *** environmental policy *** economic instruments *** policy approaches *** environmental innovations *** sustainable development *** economic instruments *** environmental policy	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2000)2	WORKSHOP ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FROM PUBLIC RESEARCH	2000	W1	Objectives:  To compare policy initiatives and practices in OECD countries to better exploit the intellectual property (IP) generated from publicly funded research. To identify good IP management strategies at the national and institution level in order to minimize conflict of interest, facilitate the broad dissemination of publicly funded IP, and foster the commercialisation of research. To explore how policies and strategies for managing IP from public research can enhance economic development and growth. Introductory Session: What are the Main issues? This session will focus on the key issues and tensions that national governments face in formulating a public research IP Strategy. Session 1 Member Country Policy Approaches: In this session, experts from OECD countries will present novel strategies and policies instituted over the past decade to encourage greater commercialisation of public sector IP. The current state-of-affairs in IP policy, main challenges/problems makers face, and recent reforms and outcomes will also be addressed. Session 2 Examples of Best Practices: This session will present the views of scientists, administrators, and industrialists on the role the central government can play to facilitate the exploitation of public sector IP and the mediation of problems that emerge in several domains, including: 1) the maximisation of economic spillovers  e.g. the importance or effectiveness of national clauses and other strategies to encourage domestic exploitation of innovations; 2) conflict management  e.g. the impact of a greater emphasis on IP on the public sector research agenda; and 3) institution building  e.g. the costs and benefits of standardized national IP ownership rules. Session 3 Economic Impacts: This session will focus on the economic impacts of a more active public sector IP strategy and address the strengths and weaknesses of current evaluation systems.	intellectual property *** funded research *** commercialisation of research *** intellectual property *** public research *** public research *** public sector *** policy approaches *** intellectual property *** public sector *** best practices *** public research sector *** evaluation systems *** public sector *** economic impacts *** public research *** intellectual property	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2001)1/REV1	WORKSHOP ON PUBLIC_PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION	2001	W1	The objectives of the workshop are to: (1) Examine the role of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (Public Private Partnerships) as an instrument to leverage public investment in Science and Technology and innovation and to achieve other socio- economic goals of technology and innovation policy; (2) Identify the critical factors determining the success of Public Private Partnerships for innovation, with an emphasis on programme design, financial arrangement, and evaluation, from both the public sector and business perspective; and (3) Provide guidance for the implementation of the on-going OECD project on PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS for innovation, including the preparation of the planned Mexico/OECD Conference and other related work of the OECD Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy. The 3 sessions are the following.  Session 1 The changing role of PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (Public Private Partnerships) in technology and innovation policy: Public Private Partnerships are not a new but an increasingly popular approach in innovation policy. OECD governments are faced with the challenge of further exploiting the potential of Public Private Partnerships without distorting market forces or compromising the missions of public organisations. Based on the presentation of country experiences, this session will discuss the changing and prospective role of Public Private Partnerships, relative to traditional support through tax incentives or direct funding of business Research and Development, as a policy tool for promoting innovation. Session 2 Public/Private Partnership to promote the development and diffusion of advanced technologies: Since the 1980s a number of OECD governments have initiated specific programmes aimed at promoting the development and diffusion of advanced technologies in partnership with the private sector. They have been in some countries subject to a recurrent policy debate, motivating thorough evaluation studies of  their rationale and cost-effectiveness. They appear to remain for most governments an important tool to enhance national capabilities in technological areas that are considered of strategic importance for sustained innovation-led growth. This session will compare national approaches and derive lessons regarding the factors of success in the design and management of Public Private Partnerships to promote  advanced technologies. Session 3, Public Private Partnerships to build innovative networks: Building new linkages within innovation systems, or improving existing ones, are key primary or  secondary objectives of a growing number of policy initiatives throughout the OECD area. This can be done through a variety of often combined instruments, ranging from regulatory reforms to institution- building and conditional support to Research and Development. Monitoring the impact of these network-oriented policies and assessing their efficiency are particularly challenging tasks. This session will  compare  national approaches to building innovative networks and discuss issues concerning the monitoring and evaluation of relevant Public Private Parnership programmes.	public sector *** public private partnerships *** public investment in research *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** policy profiles *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** private sector *** development and diffusion *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** innovation systems *** regulatory reform *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2005)1	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS AN ECONOMIC ASSET. KEY ISSUES IN VALUATION AND EXPLOITATION	2005	W1	Background: Intellectual assets, such as patents, play a pivotal role in fostering innovation and economic growth in a knowledge-based economy. Effective management and exploitation of intellectual assets can improve business performance and competitiveness. Patents are an important element of a firms intellectual asset portfolio and are increasingly managed as assets by companies. They are used to access financial markets (using patents as certificates of quality or as collateral), and they are bought, sold and traded in technology markets, notably through licensing contracts. Recent developments in financial regulations (e.g. Basel II) and in accounting  standards (IFRS, GAPP) have encouraged financial and market uses of intellectual property and notably patents. The relative novelty of these issues creates a need to improve knowledge and information, both quantitative and qualitative, about intellectual property exploitation and valuation. It also generates  demand for an integrated policy framework in order to enhance economic growth. With the objective to exchange information on the current status and developments on the economic exploitation and valuation of intellectual property and explore related policy-relevant issues, the European Patent Office, the German Ministry of Economy and Labour and the OECD co-organise a conference to be held in Berlin on 30 June and 1 July 2005. The conference is organised as part of the OECD activity on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Diffusion of Knowledge of the CSTP Programme of Work 2005-2006 and will contribute  to OECD work on Intellectual Assets and Value Creation, in particular to the analysis of impacts of intellectual asset management on the firm and economy-wide performance. Specific objectives of the conference are to: (i) Review the strengths and weaknesses of the current institutional infrastructures for patent valuation and exploitation. (ii) Advance business practice and policy making regarding the valuation and exploitation of patents. (iii) Establish a platform for experts from business, government and the academic world to exchange knowledge and experience of the state of the art and future developments in many countries. (iv) Identify and examine ways in which public sector players, along with private ones, can improve the effectiveness of the system of IP valuation and exploitation. It will examine key issues, such as: (i) How are patents valued by companies, investors and market analysts? (ii) What methods are available for valuation and which are the most appropriate? (iii) How do companies leverage their patents to create value, such as through self-exploitation, inward and outward licensing, and raising capital? (iv) How can markets for technology be best utilised to foster technology diffusion and create value? (v) How do levels of intellectual property (IP) commercialisation compare across countries and regions in terms of size and economic importance?	fostering innovation *** knowledge-based economy *** economic growth *** intellectual assets *** intellectual assets *** technology markets *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** policy frameworks *** economic growth *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** diffusion of innovation *** intellectual assets *** diffusion of knowledge *** public sector *** technology markets *** technology diffusion *** intellectual property *** intellectual property	objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2005)2	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH USE OF PATENTED KNOWLEDGE	2005	W1	Objectives: The objective of the conference is to better understand the impact of patents on the conduct of research and develop policy recommendations for research use of patented knowledge. Experts, industry representatives and legal practitioners will review the range of different means available for researchers to access patented knowledge across countries, notably research use exemptions in patent law, and the extent to which they are effectively used. The question of whether patenting is impeding access to inventions for research purposes will be addressed and evidence will be presented on reported challenges regarding the research use of patented knowledge within the research and business community. Information about technology fields where challenges are most frequently found will also be presented. Session 1: How do researchers use patented inventions and knowledge contained in patents for research purposes? Differences across fields. Session 2: How do patents affect access to inventions for research purposes? Session 3: Are there differences in the scope of research exemptions across patent systems (in practice)? Session 4: Is patent licensing needed (and used) for research? Session 5: Will working solutions continue to work?

DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2007)l/REVl	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE TIP WORKSHOP ON Research and Development TAX TREATMENT IN OECD COUNTRIES. COMPARISONS AND EVALUATIONS.PDF	2007	W1	The development of tax incentives for business Research and Development: Tax incentives have become one of the main instruments of innovation policy. Numerous countries use them as general instruments for improving the domestic environment for Research and Development expenditure without  any sectoral or technological targeting, in contrast with subsidies. Beyond the goal of encouraging Research and Development in order to boost innovation and competitiveness, there is now the question of a country's attractiveness in terms of Research and Development activities. Some 20  OECD countries use tax instruments to encourage firms to increase  their Research and Development expenditure, and such instruments are also being developed in non-member countries, including in China. Depending on the country, tax concessions or credits are calculated either on a volume share of Research and Development expenditure, an incremental share, or a mix of both. The development of these instruments increases the need for international comparisons, not only in order to measure their incentive effect, but also to gauge their relative effectiveness and identify best practices. However, the variety of different systems also  makes comparisons more difficult. Both the OECD and the European Commission have already provided studies aimed at increasing information and launching international comparisons. In addition to comparisons between systems, international co-operation could further the evaluation of policies to promote Research and Development. There will be 3 sessions. Session 1 on trends: Tax incentives for Research and Development are increasingly used as a tool for governments to encourage innovation. There are several reasons for this (e.g. horizontal measure and non- discriminatory, avoids selection of winners). At the same time, Research and Development is becoming more global and firm Research and Development investments are more footloose. Governments are consequently keen on stimulating new investments in Research and Development as well as retaining and attracting Research and Development investments. This session will focus on international comparisons of different schemes in different countries. It will address the following issues: Which countries are using Research and Development tax incentives? What are the main characteristics? Are different types of companies targeted and/or different types of expenditures (i.e. differentiation on the basis of size, ceiling, and limits on certain expenditures)? How to measure the reduction in costs represented by tax concessions? How do tax incentives fit in the overall policy mix for supporting Research and Development and innovation (e.g. subsidies, grants, reductions in social security contributions)? Session 2 will focus on presentations by different countries of the evaluations they have carried out, drawing on standard cost/benefit models and econometric evaluations as evaluation using micro-data. Key Issues include: Past and ongoing evaluation methods in different countries. What has worked? What hasn't and what are the solutions? Quantitative impact on corporate Research and Development (leverage effect) or changes in behaviour as regards types of pro}ects or partnerships (behavioural additionality) Methods for measuring the interaction of tax credits with other forms of support to business Research and Development support, such as subsidies. The panel of session 3: Many OECD governments are grappling with how to improve the use and impact of tax incentives. But tax incentives are not a panacea, and require a proper design that would reflect country context and effective monitoring. This policy discussion will focus on how countries have modified or are attempting to modify their Research and Development tax incentives in light of evaluations and international best practice. It may be interesting to consider  both design of tax incentives and implementation/management issues, such as control or interactions with other policies.	business research and development *** tax incentives *** research and development expenditures *** research and development activities *** research and development expenditures *** research and development expenditures *** best practices *** international co-operation *** policy evaluations *** tax incentives *** research and development expenditures *** research and development expenditures *** tax incentives *** research use *** policy mix *** tax incentives *** supporting research and development *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** supporting research and development *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** best practices *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems	overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives

DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2009)1	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE TIP WORKSHOP ON FUTURE ORIENTATIONS FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICY	2009	W1	The objective: The aim of this forward looking workshop is to help the TIP develop a longer-term strategy and vision in light of future trends, both societal and technological. It takes as a departure the viewpoint that grand challenges of today and tomorrow, most notably, environmental sustainability may require a paradigm shift in STI policy to achieve sustainable economic growth. The OECD Innovation Strategy and the OECD Green Growth Strategy are two vehicles which provide an opportunity for the TIP to contribute both conceptually and empirically to a new approach to innovation in order to meet future challenges. The structure: The first part of the workshop presents a general overview of the future societal and technological challenges facing societies at large. The second part looks at how governments use futures thinking to develop forward looking STI strategies. The third part of the workshop looks ahead and  beyond the current innovation thinking embodied in the National Innovation Systems (NIS) Framework  and the OECD Innovation Strategy to consider the new challenges for innovation policy making and to identify areas for future work by the TIP. The background: The economic crisis has increased the importance of the OECD strategic framework for national innovation policies and for the role of innovation in the world economy. Since the early 1990s the TIP has been a reference think tank for innovation policy development based on a system approach. The National Innovation System gave a methodological and policy framework to help countries develop a broad-based innovation strategy that takes advantage of the multi-stakeholder character and interactive dynamics of innovation systems, linking both supply and demand. The OECD Country studies have been also a reference for national reform programmes thanks to the application of this framework. But the accelerating pace of the globalisation of Research and Development and innovation has put the model of national innovation systems under strain. The NIS approach always stressed the uniqueness of each countrys institutional set-up (no one size fits all), but often was reduced to the evolutionary ideal of a complete, rather self-contained national innovation system. The internationalisation and intertwining of regional  and national systems and the emergence of international systems (like the EU) present a new context. The OECD and the TIP in particular have a key role in taking stock of the new requirements for STI policy in this evolving context	environmental sustainability *** economic growth *** green growth *** national innovation systems *** policy development *** policy frameworks *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** globalisation of research *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** internationalisation_globalisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2009)2	TIP POLICY ROUNDTABLE ON STI GOVERNANCE VIENNA - DRAFT AGENDA	2009	W1	The background: Among the topics, TIP delegates have put on the table for consideration, it is suggested that the Vienna Roundtable focus on the first two of the following: Prioritisation, STI Governance to meet Societal Agendas, National STI governance arrangements to facilitate international co-operation. Each of these topics is being addressed in both national and OECD contexts (e.g. CSTP project on New approaches and governance mechanisms for multilateral co-operation in STI to address global challenges). Choosing the third topic has the additional advantage of complementing on-going work in this very important OECD project and focusing on national governance arrangements facilitating international co-operation. The recent economic crisis has demonstrated the need for industrialised and knowledge-based societies to develop a more holistic view on knowledge for innovation, by better linking research, innovation and education through appropriate governance mechanisms. This issue should be discussed notably under the second topic. Topic 1: Prioritisation. This session could address the following questions:: How are OECD countries responding to the growing pressure to prioritise their STI activities? How is this done in practice? How detailed or at what level of granularity should priorities be identified?  What are the criteria for prioritisation? How to balance specialisation vs. diversification of research activities? Whether to focus on high-tech sectors or support the innovation needs of established industries? How to balance meeting short-term needs vs. a focus upon longer-term opportunities. Topic 2: STI Governance to meet Societal Agendas This session could focus on the following questions: What are the governance challenges associated with fostering the multidisciplinary research needed to meet societal agendas? Who are the new actors, if any, in the articulation and delivery of these societal agendas, and what does this mean for STI governance more broadly? What incentives are in place for scientists, engineers, and innovators to participate in and fulfil the promise of such agendas?	international co-operation *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** global challenges *** governance arrangements *** international co-operation *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** research activities *** support innovation *** governance arrangements *** societal agendas *** governance arrangements *** new actors *** societal agendas *** governance arrangements	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2011)2	TIP-OECD WORKSHOP ON KNOWLEDGE NETWORKS AND MARKETS.pdf	2011	W1	Following the Innovation Strategy, the OECD Directorate  for  Science,  Technology and  Industry (DSTI) is embarking on a new project on the role of Knowledge Networks and Markets (KNMs) in fostering innovation. This workshop brings together subject experts and members of the OECD Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) to build a comprehensive picture of the use of knowledge exchange mechanisms by firms  and organisations.  The workshop will provide the basis for  a discussion  on what are the high priority policy issues that OECD should work on to identify best  practices on the  basis of available and newly emerging  evidence. Session 1: Markets for technology and the future of open innovation. This session will look at the increasingly prevalent role of intermediaries in shaping the growth and development of markets for technical knowledge, considering key trends and business models. The implications for the future of technology sourcing and business open innovation will be assessed in the context of intangible asset management strategies adopted by businesses across sectors. Session 2: Public-Private markets  for  knowledge:  Strategies for commercialising and disseminating research This session looks at the complex and pivotal role played by publicly funded knowledge and its exploitation, commercialisation and wider diffusion in society through markets and networks. The various mechanisms that enable the diffusion of this knowledge and its further contribution to science and innovation will be considered, reflecting on the balance of proprietary and alternative models alongside other, less explicit, diffusion channels. Final roundtable. Spearheaded by the roundtable of invited experts, this concluding  session  will  allow  workshop participants to identify priorities for the research agenda for the KNM project and policy questions to be addressed by the OECD project on Knowledge Networks and Markets and the TIP project on Financing, Transferring  and Commercialising Knowledge.  Key questions include: What is the missing evidence regarding the measurement of KNM mechanisms and their impact on the performance of their users, particularly their innovation outcomes? What are the wider impacts of KNMs and their overall contribution to the economy and society?

DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(2011)3	TIP THEMATIC WORKSHOP ON FINANCING Research and Development AND INNOVATION IN THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT	2011	W1	three factors characterise the economic framework conditions of many oecd countries: i) low demand, ii) continued challenges in the financial sector, and iii) limited public budgets. these factors pose a challenge for innovation policy that aims at ensuring innovation performance will not be affected in the longer term. the aim of this workshop is to discuss the financing of research and development in the present macroeconomic context. it aims at identifying current and future trends in research and development investments from the perspective of major groups of actors: private large and small businesses, the financial sector and public policy makers. beyond taking stock of the conditions and characteristics of research and development investments, a major focus is on understanding the importance of financing constraints and how these might shape the direction of research and development investments. moreover, a central question that will be addressed is whether there are new distinct types of financing arrangements that allow supporting research and development in the current context. session 1: trends and outlook for financing research and development and innovation. the global financial crisis of 2008 followed by a modest recovery and high levels of public debt in many oecd economies challenge the capacity of both the public and private sectors to finance research and development and innovation investments. this section will discuss current and future trends in research and development and innovation expenditures the current macroeconomic context and discuss the importance of financing constraints. what do we know about the evolution of different types of research and development and innovation investments from 2008 to the present? what are the long-term risks imposed by trends in investments in innovation as shaped by the current macroeconomic situation? what are currently the main constraints for research and development and innovation investments? how binding are financing constraints? session 2: innovative models for financing research and development: the business perspective. with severe constraints on public financial resources, the question of the role the private sector can play in sustaining efforts is of substantial relevance. the purpose of the session is to: i) explore the perspective of the private sector on constraining factors for research and development, and ii) discuss innovative models for financing research and development. what is the current state of business research and development financing? what are possible future trends? is long-term business innovation performance under threat? which types of research and development investments, if any, have been hampered? how are various types of businesses (small, large, etc.) affected? how important were lay-offs of personnel involved in research and development-related activities in terms of costs and opportunities for future research and development investments? are there different and new types of financing arrangements more suitable to the current context? are they being explored? what does the private sector expect from the public sector in support of research and development? session 3: innovative models for financing research and development: the perspective of the public sector. the public sector has a central role to play when it comes to supporting innovation; this relates both to the provisions for financing research and development and innovation as well as to framework conditions for research and development finance. the difficult situation of public finances poses certain challenges but might also offer an opportunity for new approaches towards supporting research and development. what has happened to public research and development support policies between 2008 and the present? what is the outlook for research and development budgets for 2012 and beyond? what is the outlook for research and development aimed at generating innovations in key long-term priorities such as ageing and environmental challenges? what new instruments are being explored? are they successful? what about partnering with the private sector? what does the public sector expect from businesses and the financial sector in support of research and development and innovation? the final session will be based on four interventions aimed at opening the debate as to the future prospects for research and development in a context of possibly continued slow macroeconomic growth. the objective of the session will be to identify: i) how different actors can support research and development, and indicate ii) implications for the future activities of the tip. all speakers from previous sessions will be invited to participate in the general discussions.	framework conditions *** innovation performance *** research and development expenditures *** research and development expenditures *** supporting research and development *** supporting research and development *** innovation investments *** private sector *** supporting research and development *** innovation investments *** innovation investments *** innovation investments *** model of innovation *** supporting research and development *** private sector *** private sector *** model of innovation *** supporting research and development *** business research and development *** innovation performance *** business innovation *** research and development expenditures *** research and development expenditures *** public sector *** support research *** private sector *** public sector *** model of innovation *** supporting research and development *** public sector *** framework conditions *** supporting research and development *** support innovation *** supporting research and development *** public research and development *** supporting research and development *** environmental problems *** private sector *** public sector *** support research *** supporting research and development *** supporting research and development	objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(95)1	AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON FISCAL MEASURES TO PROMOTE Research and Development AND  INNOVATION	1995	W2	Fiscal measures to promote Research and Development and innovation have been an important aspect of the macroeconomic policy of most industrialized nations for a number of decades. These measures, which focus on the Research and Development component of the innovation process, can be divided into two broad categories: Research and Development tax credits and other special assistance programs (referred to herein simply as subsidies). The academic literature (statistical investigations as well as case studies) suggests that these measures have, at best, had   a modest impact on innovation and productivity growth, assuming that Research and Development leads to innovation and innovation leads to productivity growth1. As summarized in Table 1 below, there is a large number of countries that have implemented Research and Development- related fiscal policies and a larger number that have not. The countries that have implemented policies have relied on a combination of tax credits and subsidies. Some countries, such as France, Japan, and Sweden, have implemented both, although most countries have emphasized one type of policy measure. Three questions immediately come to mind: Which countries have been most successful with their Research and Development policies? Are tax credits more or less effective than subsidies? Is the rate of innovation different between countries with and without Research and Development policies? These are valid and important questions, although the quantitative evidence that is available is insufficient to answer either question definitively. As is generally the case when evaluating a stimulative policy, it is easier to pose the question than to answer it! However, while these questions are the ones that immediately come to mind, they are not necessarily the most relevant questions for policy makers to consider. Before policy makers (much less academics) can begin to answer either of the above questions in   a meaningful manner, there must first be a clear understanding about the intended goal(s) of the Research and Development policies. If the policy goal is simply to increase the level of Research and Development spending, then there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the adopting countries have been somewhat successful, but there is insufficient information to determine which ones have been more successful than the others. If, alternatively, the goal of the Research and Development policies is to stimulate industrial innovation, then the jury is still out.  Observations  and conclusions: Governments role in innovation, at least from an economic perspective, is to overcome market failure Market  failures  are  implicit  in  each  technology  element. Market failure occurs when firms under invest in self-financed Research and Development owing to the commercial risk of the undertaking. Market failure occurs when firms under invest in generic technology or infratechnology research, or under utilize it, because of the technical risks of the undertakings. Market failure occurs when firms under invest in basic and fundamental science because of technical risks and an inability to appropriate benefits. An appropriate role for the government is to initiate policies to solve the market failure problem. Overcoming these market failures requires fiscal measures that acknowledge all aspects of the portfolio of technical elements that affect the innovativeness of private-sector firms, and their interactions. Fiscal measures that focus exclusively on self-financed Research and Development are not inappropriate, but they should be viewed as part of a diversified public sector technology policy. Research and Development tax credits, for example, should have an effect of stimulating the level of private-sector Research and Development spending.  But that alone in not enough.  The  public sector should, being aware of the complementary nature between technological elements, also initiate measures to encourage firms to participate in the conduct of generic technology research. Such measures could take the form  of: matching grants to firms engaged in collaborative research ventures, much like is done through the ATP awards in the United States, or favorable antitrust policies to provide an incentive for firms to form research joint ventures, much like was done through the passage of the NCRA in the United States, or tax credits for involvement in a research joint venture. To elaborate on this last recommendation, we know that research joint ventures are an effective mechanism for sharing uncertainty and pooling risks. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that firms, left  to themselves, will collectively engage in more fundamental or generic research as opposed to proprietary technology research because the results from the former are less appropriable. Infratechnology research is also a key element, and the public sector should both foster continued investments in this critical technology element and establish mechanisms for the effective transfer of the technology to the private sector. As a precursor, it is recommended that governments fully understand the nature and significance of the activities that take place within their national laboratories. In the United States, detailed economic impact case studies of federal laboratory programs are being conducted and are providing important insights into how to allocate/re-allocate resources. Lastly, the science base is corner stone of the model of technology development presented in Figure 1. It is generally accepted that an appropriate role for the government is to support basic and fundamental research at universities so as to enrich this science base. A complementary strategy would be to establish mechanisms where research consortia support both fundamental and focused university-based research. The incentive to do this could take the form of matching government funding.  The advantage of this mechanism is that it establishes the private sector as a joint stakeholder in the conduct and use of the knowledge that results. One case where this has been successful in the United States is the research consortium SEMATECH and its university-based affiliate, the Semiconductor Research Corporation. To conclude, Research and Development tax policies, as practiced by OECD countries, are an effective mechanism for increasing the level of proprietary technology research. However, proprietary technology research is only one element of the portfolio of technologies that firms rely upon as inputs into the innovation process. Research and Development tax policies should thus be viewed as only one element of a more diversified fiscal strategy for stimulating innovation in the private  sector.	innovation process *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** policy measures *** tax incentives *** industrial innovation *** market failures *** market failures *** market failures *** market failures *** market failures *** market failures *** public sector *** tax incentives *** public sector *** joint ventures *** collaborative research *** tax incentives *** joint ventures *** private sector *** public sector *** science base *** technology development *** science base *** fundamental research *** private sector *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** innovation process *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** stimulating innovation	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(98)1	WORKSHOP ON COMMERCIALISATION OF GOVERNMENT-FUNDED RESEARCH	1998	W1	In many countries, an overall strategy is needed to commercialise the science base, including university research. It may be advantageous to link this to other elements of regional economic development, such as promoting innovation and entrepreneurship and attracting quality inward investment. The general operating principles of such a strategy are: commitment to long-term change; participation of the academic, business and financial communities based on vested self-interest; the entire commercialisation process (not just one stage in the process) matters; collaboration and partnerships are essential; the process varies sectorally; global and local perspectives can be reconciled;  and resources  must be used differently. The strategic aims are to increase innovation and long-term competitiveness, job creation and prosperity. Main presentations are:  A Strategic Approach to Commercialising the Science Base: Regulatory Frameworks for Commercialisation of Research; Venture Capital and Commercialisation of Research, Intellectual Property Rights and Commercialisation, Technology Transfer from Public Research in Europe; Forging partnerships to foster commercialisation: The View from Industry, The View from Government Research Agencies, The View from Higher Education Institutes	science base *** job creation *** commercialisation of research *** higher education *** public research *** intellectual property *** venture capital *** science base *** technology transfer *** funded research	policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(98)2	WORKSHOP ON TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.PDF	1998	W1	After ten years of environmental technology programmes run by the Norwegian Research  Council on behalf of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the need for rethinking goals and means becomes a question of combining a long-term strategy with short-term changes. To attract the attention and support of ministries, industry and the research community, the process of establishing a common understanding and common goals is as important as the final strategy itself. With regard to naming the environmental challenges, the choice of methodology must be made with a strong sense of communicability as relations  to societal problems serve as the key to common efforts and necessary financial resources. Based on a review of ongoing international futures and foresight activities and a study of present environmental priorities in key countries and regions, a process has been established to identify priority areas for future Research and Development efforts. In addition to the intellectual challenge of prioritising these, there is the practical challenge of matching the complexity of the environmental problems with the traditional boundaries between sciences and organisations in a small community. The methodology chosen therefore involves establishing six views of future challenges and the need for public support tools based on key players and preconditions: future challenges and the role of technology; present research activities; environmental policies and relevant governmental tools; the view of industry, both problem owners and solvers;	environmental technologies *** technology programmes *** environmental problems *** environmental problems *** research activities *** environmental policy *** sustainable development *** foresight exercises	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment

Through the use of interactive processes, the goal is to initiate a shift in the view and handling of environmental technology. A related objective is to prepare both industry and the national knowledge system for a thoroughly integrated and economically efficient way of dealing with environment as a key element in the framework of any activity and organisation. However, the limitations in the role of the Research Council and the scientific community must be taken into account and strategic links to other important initiatives must be established. An example of the latter is the inter-ministerial scenario project Norway 2030 where environment is identified as one of the cornerstones of any scenario. In a similar manner, the globalisation of the environmental challenges provides both an opportunity and a necessity    for linking the work to other international initiatives of relevance.	environmental technologies *** environmental problems *** labour market	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_human_resources
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH(99)2	WORKSHOP ON RESEARCH-BASED SPIN-OFFS 2	1999	W1	Spin-offs are an important indicator of the ability of economies to commercialise research results from the public sector. This workshop will explore the importance of spin-offs as a mechanism of technology transfer and the effectiveness of policies to promote their development. The first session will compare data on public sector spin-offs across the OECD, discuss the reasons why comparable data is rare, and recommend measures to improve the situation. The second session will describe the different models of spin-offs and the possible contractual arrangements with the public sector. The third session focuses on the policy mechanisms employed to improve the environment for spin-off formation, including entrepreneurship initiatives, novel funding arrangements, and intellectual property and management support structures. This will be followed by a panel discussion of innovative policy initiatives, their impact and costs. The rapporteur will review the lessons learned and future research priorities. The final agenda item is a methodological discussion of the importance to be given to spin-offs in the broader TIP project of benchmarking the health of the science-industry interface within OECD countries.	public sector *** research results *** technology transfer *** public sector *** public sector *** intellectual property *** spin-off formation	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** firms_considered_targeted

DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(2010)1	TIP WORKSHOP ON THE OECD INNOVATION HANDBOOK	2010	W1	Workshop Topic: One of the outcomes of the Innovation Strategy process has been a call for the development of an innovation policy handbook with a view to providing more specific and tailored guidance to policy makers seeking to improve their countrys / regions innovation performance. This parallels a similar call for a toolkit to accompany the Green Growth Strategy and is inspired by other successful toolkits that have already been assembled by the OECD on other topics, e.g. the Policy Framework for Investment toolkit (see www.oecd.org/daf/investment/pfi). What all of these handbooks / toolkits have in common is a focus on getting policy makers i) to assess their countrys / regions current performance, ii) to diagnose problem areas, and iii) to apply principles and practical tools for transitioning to more desirable states of performance. Before work can begin in earnest on building the handbook, current thinking needs to be reviewed and agreement obtained on the way forward. It should be noted that the current proposal has yet to fully resolve some important issues around (for example): the conceptual basis and mechanics of a practical diagnostic component of the handbook; the opportunities and limitations of using metrics; the practical translation  of diagnostic intelligence into an implementable policy reform agenda; the ways in which the handbook might be used in practice; and user requirements and their implications in configuring handbook design options. A wider and deeper discussion of current thinking is therefore needed as part of the process of revision and refinement of the way forward for developing the handbook. Workshop Purpose: The proposed one-day workshop is intended to form an important (though not exclusive) pillar of a wider and deeper discussion of how to take forward the development of an innovation policy handbook. In particular, it will focus on identifying the range of actors and factors (structural, institutional and ideational) that shape the performance of innovation systems and their implications for policy design. Besides generating hopefully useful ideas, the workshop should also elicit commitment to the idea of a handbook and its practical implementation. Accordingly, the expected outputs and outcomes should include an explicit guiding vision for the handbook, an articulation of its scope, suggested measures for practical implementation, a timeline / roadmap for roll-out, and expressions of interest in providing contributions. Workshop Approach: The workshop will be a mix of relaying information on existing proposals for the handbook, interactive discussion and brainstorming in groups (and in plenary) on  its shape and content, and discussion of practical steps for implementation. A proposed workshop structure is attached and envisages a mix of group and plenary sessions. After some introductions, the morning break-out groups will  consider  a  number  of  concrete  STI  policy  challenges  facing  OECD  countries  with  a  view  to a) exploring the information needs of policy makers and b) identifying the gaps the handbook might potentially fill. Issues addressed are the following: Issue 1: Raising the Contribution of Public Science to Societal Goals; Issue 2: Business Research and Development Expenditure; Issue 3: Transitioning to Eco-Innovation; Issue 4: Finance for Innovative Start-Ups . Afternoon break-out groups will consider some of the practical aspects of building and using the  handbook, focusing upon the likely needs of policy users, the opportunities for the use of metrics, and the contributions that can be made by the innovation studies community. The final session of the workshop should draw together the days discussions and establish guidelines for further developing the handbook. The work of the break-out groups will be actively facilitated around semi-structured sets of questions that encourage free and creative thinking while ensuring that workshop goals are met. These questions will be circulated beforehand so that participants can familiarise themselves with the issues to be covered. Given the workshop will be held back-to-back with the June 2010 TIP meeting, it is envisaged that the majority  of participants will be drawn from TIP delegates. But others have also been invited, including selected experts from the innovation policy studies academic community. Participants will be assigned to break-out groups and notified prior to the workshop. Preferences for break-out groups will be elicited at workshop registration and honoured as far as possible.	innovation performance *** green growth *** policy frameworks *** innovation systems *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures	objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(2011)1	AD HOC SCOPING WORKSHOP ON _COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH SMART SPECIALISATION_ -  - AGENDA	2011	W1	Session 1: the baseline. Specialisation is a driving force for economic growth in a global economy and enables the exploitation of economies of scale and differentiation for the creation of value. Whereas the value-chain embodies a distribution of labour between specialised activities, actors and clusters, the concept of smart specialisation recognises a complementary role for regions in the global economy through an entrepreneurial process of discovering the knowledge specialisations that best match the innovation potential of the region. Government strategies for investing in new paths to competitive and sustainable growth have to become more effective  given  the  present  budget  constraints.  In  addition,  pooling  resources to address global challenges should go hand-in-hand with a new division of labor. In this context strategies for smart specialisation are a means for enabling structural change. However, the implications of this approach to policy development are not yet fully understood. This session will address the following questions: (a) What are the types of smart specialisation strategies that enable firms to capture value in global value chains given the factor and knowledge endowments of regions (a taxonomy)? How to design policy mixes for smart specialisation that are tailored to different regions? (b) How to avoid extreme concentration (i.e. the Midwest syndrome) while encouraging knowledge-based specialisation according to comparative advantages? (c) What is the relationship between different specialisations in an innovation eco- system? How can smart specialisation strategies be achieved by interdependent actors in clusters (e.g. universities, funding agencies, firms)? How to enable the entrepreneurial discovery process? What governance is needed, and feasible? Session 2: Quantifying the baseline. Before embarking upon smart specialisation strategies, one has to quantify the baseline from which to start. How can we measure our specialisations? And  what is the meaning of existing specialisation indicators (e.g. the Balassa index of revealed comparative advantage)? A pre-condition for the development of smart specialisation strategies is to know the characteristics of present specialisation patterns as well as to recognise the emergence of new patterns. Session 2 will address the following questions: (a) What lessons can we learn from an empirical analysis of specialisation patterns in Research and Development investments, scientific publications and patents? (b) How do these knowledge specialisations relate to economic specialisations? How can we monitor a matching of these activities in the innovation chain via appropriate conversion tables between these indicators? (c) What are the key recent specialisation trends as compared to the past trends? What type of intelligence can support smart specialisation strategies with strategic monitoring of smart specialisations? Session 3: Moving beyond the baseline: Smart specialisation as a process appears to be highly conditioned by the structure of the governance process in which decisions are co-ordinated and by the capacity of a strategic intelligence activity to inform the investment  strategies  of  separate  decision  centers  (i.e. public and private actors). In this context, smart specialisation seems a promising framework though which we can achieve co-ordination in complex decision making spaces. (a) How can clusters build a conducive environment for entrepreneurial co-discovery of and co-investment in smart specialisations? (b) What international arrangements for strategic intelligence can catalyse mutual adaptation according to comparative advantage that is dynamic. How to buffer the risks of mutual dependence (e.g. by ensuring mutual access to specialised knowledge)?	economic growth *** global economy *** smart specialisation *** global economy *** global challenges *** smart specialisation *** structural change *** policy development *** smart specialisation *** global value chains *** smart specialisation *** policy mix *** comparative advantage *** smart specialisation *** funding agencies *** smart specialisation *** comparative advantage *** smart specialisation *** specialisation patterns *** research and development expenditures *** scientific publications *** specialisation patterns *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** comparative advantage	objectives_of_policies *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** internationalisation_globalisation
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(2012)1	SECOND WORKSHOP OF THE TIP STEERING GROUP ON SMART SPECIALISATION STRATEGIES FOR INNOVATION-DRIVEN GROWTH	2012	W1	Background and Objectives: Specialisation is a driving force that enables the exploitation of economies of scale and differentiation for the creation of economic value. The OECD Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) is carrying out a two year activity on Smart Specialisation Strategies for Innovation-led Growth. The activity aims to further develop the conceptual and analytical framework for smart specialisation that combines industrial innovation as well as educational policies in order to promote new growth opportunities based on innovation and knowledge. A second aim of the activity is to develop a methodological tool kit to help countries and regions develop their own smart specialisation strategies based on a careful assessment of the opportunities, needs and available knowledge resources at local, regional and national level. The activity is led by several OECD countries and has received support from the European Commission (DG-Regio). This second TIP workshop will bring together participating countries and regions as well as representatives from the European Commission (DG Regio, IPTS), scientific institutions (ECOOM and Joanneum Research), Technopolis, academics and experts to discuss the first results of the project. Presentations by the Secretariat and invited experts will address progress on the conceptual and analytical framework for smart specialisation strategies in the context of OECD policy efforts to re-start growth and foster innovation-led structural change. In addition, progress on the indicator tool box and governance approaches will be discussed. The first drafts of the 17 country and regional case studies of smart specialisation will also be presented. More specifically, participants at the workshop will : i) evaluate the progress made; ii) draw policy lessons from the case studies and identify any problems encountered; and agree on the way forward for the project, including linking the results to the OECDs Innovation Policy Platform, a web-based policy tool and information repository of best practices on STI policies. Agenda. Opening Session: In this session progress on the OECD project on smart specialisation will be discussed including on the conceptual and analytical framework Session 1: Indicator-based profiles of smart specialisation: In this session the indicator-based profiles of the regions and countries participating in the OECD project will be presented by ECOOM of Belgium. Session 2: Governance profiles and the self-assessment key This session will present the methodological issues of the governance enquiry which intends to map existing governance mechanisms and policies for smart specialisation. The survey covers i) the current priorities, ii) the process through which these priorities are identified, and iii) the governance mechanisms and budgets used to develop these priorities. The mapping will allow national and regional policy makers to benchmark their capacity for smart specialisation strategy-making. Also in this session the self-assessment key/tool in its final version will be presented. Potential linkages to the governance and indicator profiles will be discussed as well as a version of the self- assessment key for regions outside the EU. Session 3: Case studies on smart specialisation: This session will introduce the regional and country case studies on smart specialisation strategies. Session 4: Innovation strategies for smart specialisation: towards innovation-led structural change: This session will return to the topic of the concept and rationale for smart specialisation strategies and policies, including theoretical and empirical perspectives.

DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(94)1	AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON GOVERNMENT FORESIGHT EXERCISE	1994	W2	At its meeting in May 1994, the Working Group on Innovation and Technology Policy approved the convocation of an Ad hoc Meeting of Experts on Government Foresight Exercises [document DSTI/STP/TIP(94)5]. The meeting is intended to provide a forum for a multilateral exchange of information and views on government foresight exercises, their methodologies and goals. A number of countries have already been conducting foresight exercises, some for many years. Purposes and methods differ. Although there have been bilateral relationships between countries regarding foresight activities, there has been little multilateral exchange. The desire for international comparability is increasingly discussed. During the meeting, OECD Member countries will have an opportunity to exchange information on particular foresight exercises and to discuss more generally the related issues of objectives, methodology and international comparability. Several national delegations have submitted papers describing their national foresight efforts, which will serve as the background documents for the meeting. From that base, the participants in the meeting will discuss their various national experiences and explore the issues set out below. General questions for discussion throughout the meeting are: Why do governments engage in foresight exercises? Can foresight make technology policy more efficient? Is there a need for technology foresight? What lessons may be learned from a historical perspective of foresight activities and the evolution of different methodologies, including Delphi and panels? What is the difference between technology assessment and technology foresight? What are the different methodologies used in foresight activities? What is the effect of different methodologies? Why is the Delphi method interesting? In carrying out surveys, what are the questions to be asked and how should they be framed? What are the biases? How reliable are the results? What are the effects of different time horizons? Is there a need to learn more about the instability of predictions? Is there a need to learn more about the statistical distributions of responses? How may different methodologies  be interlinked? Is  it useful to attempt to link different methodologies? How may the analysis be improved to make better use of the data? Should there be links with industry? If so, what are the appropriate links with industry and, in particular, with chabadu chabados? What are the perspectives for international comparisons and co-operation in technology foresight exercises? How might technology foresight exercises have an effect on international co-operation/competition in technology? The delegations of Japan, Germany, France, Australia, the Netherlands  and the United Kingdom have agreed to make presentations of the foresight activities in their respective countries. Ample time has been scheduled for discussion following each presentation. We encourage a lively exchange of views. The presentations will review the methodologies, structure, goals and outcomes of the exercises. Each country has articulated its motivations and philosophy for technology foresight. Each, as well, has a different level of progress and experience.  The various presentations by national delegations  will provide a look at the variety of foresight activities and exercises, the rationales for different methodologies, common methodological factors, and the lessons, experiences, and problems in designing and implementing the exercises and in making the best use of the results	foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises *** small and medium sized firms *** foresight exercises *** international co-operation *** foresight exercises *** foresight exercises	policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(94)2	AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON FISCAL MEASURES TO PROMOTE Research and Development AND INNOVATION	1994	W2	The purpose of this meeting is to provide a forum for an exchange of information and views on fiscal measures to promote Research and Development and innovation: mechanisms, efficiency, evaluation and other related policy issues. It is expected that the international dimension of the evaluation of support schemes will be discussed, but it is not intended to discuss the legitimacy of government intervention in the innovation process in a trade policy perspective. The participants in the meeting will be invited to share their various national experiences and exchange views on the issues set out below. General questions for discussion throughout the meeting include: What arguments have justified the adoption of tax support schemes? What are the main characteristics (institutional arrangement for the implementation, eligibility criteria, etc.) of the support schemes? Who are the beneficiaries (by industry, size of firms)? What is the actual cost of these schemes to government? How are the risks of tax avoidance minimised? What has been the recent evolution of public policy in this field? How are support schemes monitored and evaluated? Which are the main lessons of recent evaluations?	innovation process *** support schemes *** support schemes *** support schemes *** support schemes	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(95)1	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE AD HOC MEETING OF EXPERTS ON VENTURE CAPITAL	1995	W2	Purpose of the meeting: The role of financial factors in translating Research and Development results into economic wealth is currently re-emphasised by both private and public decision makers. Risk-taking in innovation is imperative for  firms to cope with new competitive challenges, and for society as a whole to create new sources of growth and quality jobs. The traditional ways of sharing innovation-related risks between the public and private sectors need to be reassessed in the light of the deregulation/globalisation of financial markets, of the changing investment needs of private firms, and of public budget stringency. The mobilisation of private capital for innovation is a priority objective in many Member countries. But the performance of established market mechanisms and related-government support  schemes have not always been satisfactory. Issues range from broad concerns regarding the impact of corporate governance on innovation performance to more specific ones regarding the ability of financial markets to assess and back technology or science-based start-up projects. Venture Capital  markets  (as  well as more informal business angels) have a prominent role to play in this connection, but in many countries they are both underdeveloped or biased against the early stages of innovation (seed and start-up capital for new projects). The purpose of the meeting is to provide a forum for an exchange of information and views on  the role of Venture Capital in the commercialisation of Research and Development results, and on the scope for public policies  to improve the supply of risk capital to innovative firms and projects. Presentations and discussion among participants will address the following issues: The functionning of over the counter markets and the impact of regulation on their ability   to back innovative firms efficiently; the size, breadth and function (including the supply of information on  management  know- how, markets, technological opportunities, etc.) of Venture Capital markets, and the impact   of regulation and other government policies (e.g. tax) on their development and operation; government policies to alleviate innovation-related risks and mobilise risk-capital; the approaches, measures and their effectiveness.	private sector *** private firms *** innovation performance *** venture capital *** business angels *** venture capital *** commercialisation of research *** innovative firms *** innovative firms *** venture capital *** venture capital	firms_considered_targeted *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** objectives_of_policies *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted *** firms_considered_targeted
DSTI/STP/TIP/AH/A(96)1	INFORMAL WORKSHOP ON NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS	1996	W2	The workshop will present the results of the first phase of the work of the project on National Innovation Systems and discuss approaches for improving and harmonising the methodology. It is also intended to give countries not participating in Phase I the chance to obtain an insight into the work and an opportunity to decide on participation in Phase II of the project. Countries participating in Phase I are invited to present the results of the respective pilot case studies (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom). Recent  research  done in the United States will also be presented. Countries wishing to make a presentation should notify  the Secretariat by 1 September 1996. Countries which have not participated in Phase I of the project on National Innovation Systems are invited to indicate their interest in participating in Phase II. They are also invited to give presentations at the workshop and should notify the Secretariat by 1 September 1996. Presentations will focus on one of the following: Overall description of the National Innovation System of the country. Knowledge flows in specific industrial clusters. Specific interfaces within the National Innovation System, e.g. between universities and enterprises, research institutes and enterprises, inter-industry collaboration. Based on a Secretariat document, there will be a general discussion on the orientation for further work, including the following aspects: the development of the conceptual basis and identification of the main dimensions of National Innovation Systems; the trade-off between flexibility and comparability in the research efforts of countries; the development of indicators to map knowledge-flows;	national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems *** knowledge flows *** national innovation systems *** research organisations *** national innovation systems *** national innovation systems	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_public_research *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis

DSTI/STP/TIP/RD(2004)2	MEASURING THE BEHAVIOURAL ADDITIONALITY EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT-FINANCED BUSINESS Research and Development: SUMMARY OF WORKSHOP	2004	W2	Background and objectives: This document provides a short summary of a workshop that was co-organised by the OECD and the institute for Policy Research in Engineering, Science and Technology (PREST) in Manchester, UK on Monday-Tuesday, 10-11 May 2004 to discuss ongoing and future efforts to evaluate the behavioural additionality effects of government financing of business Research and Development. The main objectives of the workshop were: to present and discuss results to date of the work under way in several countries to evaluate the behavioural additionality effects of government financing of business Research and Development; 2) compare approaches to measuring behavioural additionality and to develop means for co-ordinating activities in different countries; and 3) to discuss plans for future studies including discussion on future research directions and  development of proposals for future work to be conducted under the aegis of the OECD TIP activities. Part 1: Key points and conclusions. The workshop revealed good progress in measuring behavioural additionality, as well as interesting results. In terms of measurement, several different approaches were observed in the countries presentations. All of the studies presented used or planned to use questionnaires, interviews or a combination of the two, but the details of surveys revealed interesting differences, i.e. in terms of media used (mail, Web, telephone, face-to-face), types of people interviewed (single or multiple, manager or researcher), and analytical techniques: Austria supplemented its survey-based study with an econometric approach to quantify behavioural changes. They focused on the Research and Development employment as an indicator, and tried  to estimate to what extent the stock of Research and Development personnel was affected by public money for Research and Development. The firm-project database of the Austrian federal Research and Development support scheme (FFF) was used, and around   1 100 Research and Development performers are analysed in the time period 1995-2002. Austrias survey included recipients of FFF awards and non-recipients and asked questions about both hypothetical scenarios (e.g. would you have cancelled the project if you had not received FFF support?) and actual scenarios (e.g. did you cancel the project after not receiving an award?). Belgium tailored its approach to different populations of firms. They segmented firm population into four categories: 1) large Research and Development based firms, 2) large non-Research and Development based firms, 3) chabadu chabados without permanent Research and Development, and 4) high-tech chabadu chabados. Then the research team developed a modular questionnaire that could be customised for each segment with a module structure. Surveys were done via telephone, but a set of intake talks were conducted for the large Research and Development based firms to better understand their innovation processes, decision processes for Research and Development projects, and management of government grants. The United States evaluation of the Advanced Technology Program focused on the relative success of joint Research and Development ventures formed as a result of the programme. Determinants of success were defined (i.e. technical objectives, commercial value, patents, trust, knowledge sharing, co- ordination costs), and a survey was conducted through the Web and by telephone. They achieved a high response rate of 81% of participating firms. Although simple comparison was not available among the different approaches, the results of countries surveys brought some interesting findings. For instance, project additionality (implementation or non-implementation if public support was not given) differed by countries and by programmes. The Austrian study found that 72% of firms would carry out the project without public support (57% would change in scope and scale) in contrast with the Finnish study in which 41% claimed they would (55% for large companies, 29% for chabadu chabados). In case of the US joint venture, 92% reported that the joint venture would not have formed without the programme. Other interesting results from Austria and Belgium are summarised below: The Austrian survey showed obvious differences between hypothetical/anticipated and actual results. For example, 32% of firms anticipated that they would postpone the starting date of a project if they received no public assistance, but 43% actually did delay the start date. Therefore, acceleration additionalities (public assistance is speeding up the course of the project) were broadly underestimated. In addition, 74% of firms predicted that they would carry out the project on a smaller scale if they did not receive public assistance, but only 60% actually did so. This result implies that scale additionalities (public assistance enlarges the scale of the project) were broadly overestimated. The Belgian study showed different decision processes and different impacts of government funding on different types of firms. For example, additionality at project level was small for large Research and Development intensive companies, while strategic additionality was observed at the level  of organisations. However, large companies without permanent Research and Development indicated that the subsidies  did not suit their needs. On the other hand, subsidies had a positive impact on chabadu chabados, especially high-tech chabadu chabados, for which government-funding helped support their core activities. Throughout the workshop, participants shared the significance of behavioural additionality which could raise interesting questions about the actions of agencies and their effect on firms, the innovation process and their interactions with firms. However, participants also recognised that there were still lots of questions about how to observe and how to interpret behavioural additionality. Reality of the industry structure is complex with many types of companies and many different instruments to support them, thus extra care is needed to measure its behavioural additionality. The delay between government funding and its effect is also pointed out as a measurement problem. The common understanding among participants at the end of the workshop is there is more work required to develop a proper measuring system of behavioural additionality under international co-operation. Part 2: Next steps and future directions. Participants welcomed continuing exchanges of countries experiences, and thus they agreed to organise a follow-on workshop in the late autumn or early winter of 2004 to present results of the country studies that are planned for implementation in the summer and autumn and further discuss methodological issues. It was suggested that a synthesis of lessons learned from country studies to date be prepared and presented at the workshop. The synthesis could be further revised based on discussions at the workshop. Participants also proposed the preparation of a publication that would include the results of country studies and the revised synthesis, to provide a baseline for future efforts and to better disseminate the results of the work that will have been completed by the end of 2004. Preparation of a quality synthesis will likely require the aid of a consultant. Participants also welcomed a possible extension of the activity to other types of financing instruments and to other countries. Studies to date focus on direct government funding of business Research and Development; however participating countries could look at other mechanisms as well, such as cost-shared programmes or collaboration between firms. Norways planned study on its tax incentive for business Research and Development will be a good start toward broadening the range of instruments analysed. Finally, participants recognised the necessity of international collaboration on a broader research agenda that would provide further conceptual clarification of behavioural additionality, investigate measurement as a way of learning, and use comparative research as tool for international policy learning. Participants also proposed setting up communities of practice for evaluations that would allow open discussion of evaluation efforts and new methodologies among an international group of policy makers and evaluators. Such work could form the basis of a more extended TIP activity on evaluation.	behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** behavioural additionality *** supporting research and development *** small and medium sized firms *** innovation process *** small and medium sized firms *** joint ventures *** small and medium sized firms *** innovation process *** behavioural additionality *** behavioural additionality *** behavioural additionality *** international co-operation *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development *** business research and development *** tax incentives *** behavioural additionality *** international collaboration *** behavioural additionality *** business research and development	other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** other_policy_areas *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** internationalisation_globalisation *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** other_policy_areas *** internationalisation_globalisation *** other_policy_areas *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors
DSTI/STP/TIP/RD(2004)3	POSSIBLE FUTURE WORK ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INNOVATION AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE	2004	S	The need to increase the empirical foundation of innovation policy related to Intellectual Property Rights (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT) was recently stressed at the January 2004 meeting of OECD Ministers of Science and Technology in Paris, where they concluded that: Patent regimes play an increasingly complex role in encouraging innovation, diffusing scientific and technical knowledge, and enhancing market entry  and firm creation. As such, they should be subject to closer scrutiny by science, technology and innovation policy makers. The dual role of patents as instruments to provide incentives to innovate and means to diffuse knowledge was highlighted in the analysis and policy conclusions.Three main complementary areas have been singled out as areas where TIP could do more in-depth work: markets for technology, e.g., licensing markets, with a focus on cross-cutting issues related to the diffusion of patented inventions; research access to INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT-protected knowledge, with a focus on access and use of protected intellectual property by public research organisations (e.g., via research exemptions); protection of IP in software, to provide a sectoral perspective to the activity and examine the effects of various IP protection mechanisms (e.g., patents, copyright, open source) on innovation and diffusion of knowledge in software. Work on markets for technology could address questions such as: Do markets for technology appear to be an effective means of diffusing knowledge? Do patents facilitate the development of markets for technology? How? What is the role of patent pools and cross-licensing agreements in technology trade? What are their advantages and disadvantages? What kind of incentives do patent holders need to exploit or license patented inventions? What kind of impediments do they face as potential licensees? Are there a market or systemic failure in technology markets (e.g. patent licensing) that require government intervention? What kind of policies could be put in place? To what extent are universities and other Public Research Organisations (PROs) involved in technology markets? How can their participation be increased? What are the challenges they face? Do the answers to the previous questions differ by sector? How? Work on research access to INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT could address questions such as: Are research exemptions needed to enable the fundamental scientific research that seeds inventions? Is there evidence that researchers are not getting the kind of access they need? Is there evidence that research use is infringing on patent holders rights more than before? Why? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different options to enable research exemptions implemented across OECD countries? Work on the protection of IP in software could address questions such as: Who patents software-related inventions and how do patenting patterns vary across main OECD regions? Are software inventions different from inventions in other fields (e.g. chemicals)? In what respect? Do firms rely more on market mechanisms (i.e. market lead and secrecy) than on INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT to protect competitive advantages in the software industry? Do differences in the patentability of software related inventions across jurisdictions (or  computer implemented inventions as they are called in Europe) affect Research and Development strategies of software multinationals and the location of their Research and Development facilities? Are there effective ways to reconcile patented and open source software (e.g. disclosure requirement in patents, free licenses to selected open source developers, etc)?	intellectual property *** patented inventions *** research organisations *** research exemptions *** diffusion of innovation *** technology markets *** intellectual property *** diffusion of knowledge *** technology markets *** diffusion of knowledge *** technology markets *** patented inventions *** systemic failures *** technology markets *** research organisations *** technology markets *** scientific research *** research exemptions *** intellectual property *** research use *** research exemptions *** software industry *** intellectual property *** development strategies *** diffusion of innovation *** intellectual property *** diffusion of knowledge	policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation
DSTI/STP/TIP/RD(94)2	MODEL SURVEYS OF SERVICE INDUSTRIES: THE NEED TO MEASURE  INNOVATION	1994	S	A measurement of innovation is proposed as an addition to model surveys of service industries. Measuring the introduction of new or improved products and processes provides an additional and important characteristic of the firm as well as a better understanding of the change over time of revenues from the   set of products produced. The measurement of innovation is more complex than that of research and development, which does have a module devoted to it.  Nonetheless innovation, itself, is an important outcome of the system  of innovation which includes institutions such as firms, government laboratories, regulatory bodies, funding organizations and universities, and the interactions among these institutions. In the past, the measurement focus has been on Research and Development, on the assumption that investment in Research and Development led, through a linear chain, from research to development, invention, innovation, diffusion and on to economic growth. However Research and Development is now recognized as neither necessary not sufficient for economic growth. The collective experience of experts in many countries, and especially the Nordic countries, was brought together in the OECD Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data, the Oslo manual. The Oslo Manual was written for surveys of goods producing industries, with the intention of extending the coverage when more empirical evidence became available. This meant that the manual was limited in its treatment of organizational change as innovation, although it was included if it related directly to the production process. In service industries, organizational change may be more significant than in primary or secondary industries. Some examples serve to illustrate innovation as a result of organizational change. A bank changes staff hours to provide more service at peak times during the day. This is a process improvement as the clients are dealt with in a shorter time and it requires nothing more than a change in organization. A  retailer introduces self-service with automated check-out facilities. Again, this is a process innovation as fewer  staff  are  required  to  support  the  basic  service  of  selling  goods. In  this  case  there  is  both organizational change and investment in equipment to read bar codes and to accept credit cards.  If the  same retailer introduces a customer club, with privileges of membership, that new service is a product innovation. The proposal is that the module presented in the Appendix be adopted as part of the set of modules which constitute a Voorburg Group model survey and that data be collected for subsequent comparison at a Voorburg Group  meeting	service industries *** research investments *** economic growth *** economic growth *** organisational change *** service industries *** organisational change *** organisational change *** innovation process *** organisational change *** innovative products *** service industries	policy_area_services *** policy_area_public_research *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP/RD(94)4	INNOVATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SERVICES SECTOR	1994	R	Services supplied to customers consist of a mix of technical characteristics. Consequently, the purpose of the research or development activity is often to find ways in which the technical characteristics of products can be recombined in a new configuration that may or may not involve changing the mix of characteristics offered in the services supplied to customers. Therefore It is difficult to identify the technical novelty of a service ; The concept of prototype cannot be properly applied to services since occasionally a service will be unique and thus hard to test . Attention should be drawn to the following : The large-scale technology watch reflected in the activity of such firms ; the distinction between experimental development and industrial development is a particularly fine one. he organisational aspect poses problems in that research and development activities are usually organised by project or within ad hoc multi-skilled groups.	development activities *** research and development activities *** services sector	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services
DSTI/STP/TIP/RIHR/A(2012)1/REV1	AGENDA OF THE TIP-RIHR THEMATIC WORKSHOP ON KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER, EXPLOITATION AND COMMERCIALISATION	2012	W2	The transfer, exploitation and commercialisation of public research results is a critical area of science, technology and innovation policy. Efforts to ring-fence public research in a context of fiscal austerity in many OECD countries  as well as competition from new players  have increased pressure on universities, public research institutions (PRIs) and governments to increase the economic outputs from, and impact of, investments in public research. The mechanisms for knowledge transfer and commercialisation have changed dramatically over the past decade as a result of the globalisation of research, advances in ICTs as well as new research and business models based on open innovation and open science. It is therefore important for policy makers to take stock of recent developments and to learn from international best practice in this area. The objective is to map how technology transfer is changing today and what the implications might be for policies at governmental and institutional levels. Session 1. In recent years, many OECD countries have sought to broaden the channels for commercialisation of public research by promoting two-way flows between industry and science, for example through Public Private Partnerships, joint research initiatives/centres, outward and inward licensing of IP by universities and PRIs, and incentives for the mobility of researchers and entrepreneurial academics. This session will explore, based on examples of country policies or institutional initiatives, new channels and platforms to foster not only commercialisation but the transfer and exploitation of knowledge between public research and industry. The policy panel will discuss the following questions. Beyond traditional transfer measures, what can governments do to enhance and improve the impact of knowledge produced in universities and PRIs? Knowledge and technology transfer has been regarded for a long time as an important driver for a countrys competitiveness. What recent drivers/barriers or trends can be identified in industry-science collaborations? Rather than focusing mainly on patenting and contract research, how can other transfer channels, such as mobility, research data access, etc. be improved/ implemented/ supported by policy?

It is a complex process involving top down and bottom up approaches and different tools and metrics, including evaluation, technology foresight, S&T road mapping and other strategic intelligence tools that support this policy process. As research and innovation take on a more central role in economic development but also as S&T is solicited to help governments meet societal challenges on a global scale, the setting of priorities for public RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and innovation has become more complex and more urgent. Among the key issues that have emerged that affect the process of priority setting are: (1) How can policy structures be designed to ensure coherence in the process of priority setting? (2) How to deal with the rise in the number of quantitative/indicator-based and consultative mechanisms for setting priorities? In particular, how to ensure methodologies are sound and how to select the right tools for setting priorities in different contexts (e.g. priorities for big science or global challenges, versus priorities for basic longer-term research)?  Today, priority setting is an expert supported consultative mechanism that continues to rely on some of the same tools used in the past. These developments raise several issues, including: (1) How to set priorities to meet economic and social goals while avoiding short termism and maintaining capacity for longer-term research? (2) Should priorities for research be systematically set according to social and economic objectives or should countries set them according to system requirements? (3) How to canvass support and involvement of various stakeholders while maintaining focus and accountability? (4) How far can the priority process by democratised? Who should be involved? (5) How to set thematic priorities (transport, energy) that cut across different ministerial portfolios, research institutions and funding agencies?  The effective implementation of S&T priorities is dependent on shared visions and clearly defined plans in which the interests and objectives of various stakeholders and actors must be well aligned. This requires a well functioning governance structure in which information and responsibilities related to priority setting flow and are shared between national S&T priority setting agencies and funding agencies, regions, research performing institutes, etc. Co-ordination issues and problems often arise. While governments may have clearly established and formal channels, informal channels are also important and in certain conditions, may play a greater role in turning priorities into practice. Priorities in one field often have consequences for spending in other fields. For example, an increased focus on nanotechnology may result in greater attention or priority in a given area of mathematics. Another challenge is monitoring and evaluating the implementation of priority setting exercises so as to ensure accountability of different actors. This requires political buy-in from the different stakeholders and the creation of indicators and data to monitor policy or programme effectiveness. Key issues include: (1) The need for efficiency in the process of priority-setting in order to improve impacts of public investment in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT on national competitiveness and societal challenges (e.g. poverty alleviation, health). (2) How can the use of (ex ante) evaluations for priority setting be improved? (3) What has been the impact of priority setting on the scientific and technological specialisation pattern of countries? (4) How to adjust research funding, infrastructure and human resource capacities in light of new or a shift in thematic priorities? (5) How to better monitor and assess the implementation of priorities? What are the data requirements?  While science has always been international, the acceleration in the global flows of ideas, capital and people are affecting how national priorities are set. Large countries or those with world-class specialisation have long set the tone for smaller countries, helping them focus on areas of comparative advantage and expertise. However, it is becoming clear that in order to meet national as well as global challenges, the process of priority setting must further integrate developments outside national borders. At the same time, as countries increasingly use similar tools or techniques to set priorities, the resulting areas of shared or common focus make the case for stronger cross-border co-operation or joint programming in order to increase critical mass and achieve goals. Key issues in this area include: (1) To what extent are national priority setting exercises increasingly internationalised? (E.g. what is the role of foreign experts, or use of international benchmarking indicators). (2) How to set national priorities in light of global or supranational priority trend setting (e.g. the European Research Area initiative, Global agendas such as Millennium Development, G8, and Kyoto)? (3) To what extent does convergence of national research priorities and programmes lead to duplication, healthy competition or stronger co-operation? (4)How to define joint priorities among different countries?	priority setting *** policy processes *** foresight exercises *** societal challenges *** public research and development *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting *** global challenges *** priority setting *** priority setting *** funding agencies *** research organisations *** funding agencies *** priority setting *** governance arrangements *** research performance *** priority setting *** public investment in research *** societal challenges *** priority setting *** priority setting *** human resources *** funded research *** comparative advantage *** priority setting *** global challenges *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting *** research performance	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI/STP/TIP/SFRI/AH(2008)1/REV1	WORKSHOP PROGRAMME ENHANCING RESEARCH PERFORMANCE THROUGH EVALUATION AND PRIORITY SETTING	2008	W1	The evaluation of public research has evolved from its initial focus on improving the quality of research by evaluating discrete outcomes of research (e.g. publications) to more complex attempts to evaluate and assess economic and non-economic social effects of research as well as environment and ecology system-wide effects. This evolution has gone hand-in-hand with the emergence of new tools (e.g. microdata sources, large socio-economic datasets), evolvement of the theoretical underpinnings for evaluation, in response to changes in the way public RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT is financed and performed, and changes in the way innovation occurs (e.g. open science, multidisciplinary research, open innovation, globalisation). Session 1 will draw on the experience of countries in the evaluation of public research, focusing on institutional level policies and practices in order to identify the building blocks of an evaluation system. It will contrast centralised and decentralised approaches and draw findings from the TIP country case studies on the architecture of evaluation systems. Issues include: What types of institutional structures are needed to support evaluation at a systems level? What should be the role of standalone agencies, of units within different agencies and what should be the linkages between them? What are good policy practices for the governance of such agencies (legislation and rules, internal, external)? What are the data system requirements for evaluation at various levels (programme, project, institution)? What are the skills needed for systems evaluation ? Session 2. The use of evaluation in policy making does not always follow formal or well established procedures. Evaluations are selected and used depending on the nature of policy interventions. Evaluation tools such as expert panels, audits, and surveys must be selected with care to ensure credibility. Local stakeholders and international experts play a key role in this process. While evaluations often involve a range of stakeholders, there is often little feed-back to participants in the evaluation process which limits the use or collective learning. Some evaluations are used with an instrumental purpose such as to adjust programmes or policies. Other times evaluations are used persuasively or to justify policy actions. But they can also have unintended uses by non-target audiences. Furthermore, their usefulness also take place at different levels. Individual participants in evaluation exercises can gain benefits from the evaluation as can organisations, collectively. Key issues in this session include: How can evaluations be used to ensure the legitimacy of policy interventions and the relevance of evaluations? What is the role of ex-post evaluations in the implementation process?How to better link evaluation results with research budgeting mechanisms and decisions? To what extent do evaluations have an impact on the policy mix for research and innovation policies?	priority setting *** policy processes *** foresight exercises *** societal challenges *** public research and development *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting *** global challenges *** priority setting *** priority setting *** funding agencies *** research organisations *** funding agencies *** priority setting *** governance arrangements *** research performance *** priority setting *** public investment in research *** societal challenges *** priority setting *** priority setting *** human resources *** funded research *** comparative advantage *** priority setting *** global challenges *** priority setting *** priority setting *** priority setting *** research performance	policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment
DSTI_STP_TIP(2012)19	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE TIP OUTREACH WORKSHOP ON SMART SPECIALISATION	2012	W2	The objective: Following the publication of the OECD report on Innovation-driven Growth in regions: the role of smart specialisation (expected for March 2013), the OECD is organising a workshop with the Korean Delegation in Gwangju. The workshop will discuss the policy concept of smart specialisation, its practical implications and its extension to Asia with a specific focus on the Photonics industry. The background: The OECD report brings together the key findings from the project on Innovation- driven Growth in regions: the role of smart specialisation based on a review of the literature, the  identification of indicators and metrics for smart specialisation strategies, an enquiry of governance and priority setting processes and 15 country and regional case studies carried out for the project under the auspices of the OECDs Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP). Smart Specialisation is a regional policy framework for innovation driven growth. What distinguishes smart specialisation from traditional industrial and innovation policies is mainly the process defined as entrepreneurial discovery an interactive process in which market forces and the private sector are discovering and producing information about new activities and the government assesses the outcomes and empowers those actors most capable of realising the most promising market opportunities. Incentives and instruments for disclosing  passively or actively  this information (e.g. through stakeholder consultations, Public Private Partnerships, prizes, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs) will be key. Smart specialisation focuses on helping entrepreneurs identify their knowledge-based strengths in a more exploratory approach in which public decision makers listen to market signals using a range of assessment tools (e.g. SWOT analysis, surveys) and mechanisms such as Public Private Partnerships, technology foresight and roadmapping to name a few.	smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** priority setting *** smart specialisation *** policy frameworks *** smart specialisation *** private sector *** public private partnerships *** intellectual property *** smart specialisation *** public private partnerships *** foresight exercises *** smart specialisation	policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_smart_specialisation
DSTI_STP_TIP(2013)1	PROGRESS REPORT  to CSTP	2013	M	The Working Party celebrated its 20th Anniversary and 40th meeting on 12-14 December 2012. Part A : Finalise the activities being carried out under the  CSTPs 2011-2012 PWB : Activity 2.1 Transitioning to green innovation and technology: The role of supply and demand-side polices. Completed. Experience from the participating countries suggests a key role for new institutional frameworks and processes to improve governance and co-ordination between the different actors. Activity 2.2 Innovation Policy Platform : The TIP held a workshop on the IPP on 25 June 2012 that brought together the producers and users of policy information, including partner institutions such as the European Commission and the World Bank. Activity 2.3 Financing, transferring and commercialising knowledge : recent developments such as open innovation and open science are shaking up the process of commercialising the results of publicly funded research, with implications for policy makers. The decline in venture capital activity for new firms and the rise of new modes of financing innovation (e.g. crowd funding) are also resulting in new approaches to commercialising research. Activity 2.4 Designing smart specialisation strategies for innovation driven growth : The Secretariat is editing the final report for declassification and subsequent publication. In addition, the Korean Government will host an Outreach Workshop. Activity 2.5 Research and Development and innovation in services : completed. The TIP has produced the final policy report. Part B : Progress on activities underway in the 2013-2014 PWB. (a) Chabada chabado : This activity will explore the conceptual and analytical basis of chabada chabado, defined as a policy approach that focuses on transitioning technological innovation systems on more sustainable paths. This is in contrast to mainstream innovation policies that focus on increasing the rate of innovation by removing barriers or addressing market and systems failures. Examples include the shift of transport, energy, and agri-food systems towards sustainability. (b) Innovative Public Private Partnerships in Science and Technology : The aim of this activity is thus to take stock of the recent trends in innovative partnership around the key and enabling technologies, notably ICTs, nanotechnology and biotechnology, with a particular focus on new governance and financing arrangements that have emerged in recent years.. (c) Open Science : The project will result in one analytical report scoping the potential for a policy recommendation on open science and new forms of intellectual property management for fostering research and innovation, especially as regards green growth. The activity should also provide evidence of the potential social and economic benefits of openness in the research process (e.g. greater returns from public investments). The activity could also help co-ordinate a consultation at international level among OECD countries on developing common standards and interoperable systems among different research institutions. The TIP has taken a modular approach and will explore the following key areas: (1) Open data, focusing on issues such as interoperability and infrastructure (2) Open access to scientific research results, focusing on analysis of the economic and research impact of greater access to public research data; (3) Open research and communication, examining best practices for promoting openness in and the sharing of research, e.g. via online platforms for science- science collaboration.	green technology and innovation *** funded research *** open science *** commercialising knowledge *** open innovation *** venture capital *** new modes *** smart specialisation *** innovation in services *** policy approaches *** innovation systems *** systems innovation *** systemic failures *** intellectual property *** green growth *** public private partnerships *** new forms of innovation *** open science *** public investment in research *** international level *** research organisations *** public research *** open data *** open access *** best practices *** research results *** scientific research	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** firms_considered_targeted *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_services *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_research *** internationalisation_globalisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI_STP_TIP(2013)2	SUMMARY RECORD OF THE TIP STEERING GROUP WORKSHOP ON CHABADA CHABADO HELD ON 28 MARCH 2013 AT THE OECD CONFERENCE CENTRE	2013	W2	The TIP has launched a two-year activity on chabada chabado, a concept that is linked closely to the goal of achieving green growth by combining market forces and technological innovation to decouple environmental degradation and natural resource depletion from economic growth. It is a concept that is  also linked to the issue of meeting the grand or global challenges of today such as health, food security, resilient water systems. These global challenges require action across technological, economic and social structures and boundaries, as well as national borders. Chabada chabado postulates that innovation in discrete socio-technical-industrial systems is not sufficient to bring large-scale change in technological and social systems. Large scale change requires innovation not just in technology but also in social systems and in the relationship between the social and technical systems. This line of thinking poses a challenge for policy makers as changes brought about by technology and innovation are largely endogenous processes and mainly driven by entrepreneurial and market forces. A key element of chabada chabado is that there are transition paths towards more sustainable socio-technical systems and the government has a role in enabling, facilitating and managing such crucial transitions. Consequently, steering group members for the TIP project organised a workshop to further scope the conceptual issues [DSTI/STP/TIP (2013)3] and to develop a common language among policy analysts, business representatives, academics and leading thinkers on the issue. Part 1: Defining characteristics of chabada chabado. Delegates and experts were of the view that chabada chabado is essentially about large technological systems that fulfil societal functions such as provision of energy, food, transport but also culture. Chabada chabado was also seen as characterised by a focus on longer term goals, not only short- term economic efficiency. It is driven by a by a collective good problem. Policy makers want to solve social problems by steering innovation towards certain directions. To enable chabada chabado, however, delegates pointed out the importance of both market mechanisms (prices) and policy processes  (regulations) that could internalise externalities. Another defining characteristic was that system  innovation could be viewed through the prism of sectors and specific technologies. In contrast to the national innovation system where the rationales for action are bounded by similar goals among different actor (i.e. profit-maximising firms), chabada chabado implies a more contentious relation between the different stakeholders as a change in a socio-technical system implies winners and losers. In this context, delegates noted that power relations and conflict management were also defining characteristics of chabada chabado. The dynamics and temporality of chabada chabado was another issue that was touched upon. Change in large technical systems takes time, sometimes twenty to thirty years. There are many dynamic factors within and outside large technological systems. Actors in the system interact and navigate their positions. Culture and social acceptance of change was also noted as requiring time; social movements however are not always predictable and constitute tipping points in transitions. The temporal dimension was also stressed by the notion that change emerges from existing systems; that one does not move from  on an inefficient system to an ideal model overnight. Another way to look at chabada chabado was to think of it in terms of means  and ends.  Families of technologies  from ICTs to new materials and energy storage devices can have a radical impact on other technologies that will change the transport sectors. In other words, change in large technological systems can affect individual sectors. Part 2: Role of government. Chabada chabado as a concept also calls into question the rationale for government action which is often based on market and system failure arguments. Participants suggested there could be other failures such as directionality failure or demand articulation failures, policy co-ordination failures or reflexivity failures. While co-ordination and demand articulation failures may lend themselves easily to government action, other failures may not be of the sole remit of government and could be resolved in conjunction with market mechanisms such as prices. Delegates cautioned against taking too much of academic approach to policy rationales.  Political process and the timeline for policy planning also  emerged as issues given that transitions take a longer time but politicians and policy makers work on shorter-time schedules, 3 to 5 years. Several countries offered suggestions from existing policies to illustrate a government led approach to chabada chabado. Germany offered the High Tech Strategy as a challenge oriented and disruptive approach to chabada chabado. The Netherlands discussed the TOP Sector strategy and bio- based economy project as an example of chabada chabado policy. The United Kingdom noted that systems thinking is present in the governments innovation strategy but that the real challenge lied in policy development and implementation and in bringing a systems approach to the functions of  government policies and not just understanding the linkages among different elements. Part 3: Role of business. Business is the central driver behind innovation and Delegates agreed that chabada chabado was largely a business driven process. But there were questions surrounding the role of companies, especially the large incumbents in facilitating or blocking transitions of large technological systems to more sustainable paths. There were also questions surrounding the role of start-ups in a transition framework. Much of policy support to business innovation in OECD countries is tailored discriminately to large and small companies given their different needs and differences in the barriers to innovation that they face. Yet policy makers have little understanding of the connections between small and large firms and their respective roles in a chabada chabado framework. Business was, however, seen as especially important for the development of critical infrastructure that facilitates systems change. But here, national context and the different styles of capitalism were seen  as significant. In countries with more corporatist structures chabada chabado, government may have a more direct influence on outcomes, while in more laissez-faire systems where prices play a stronger role in the reconfiguration of systems; government action may be more indirect. Bottom up process in entrepreneurial economies might be favoured in some countries whereas more government-led co- ordination may be favoured in other systems. Uncertainty with regard to demand was seen as a factor limiting the uptake of new technologies such as smart grids, smart meters that could limit or slow the transition between systems. Without change in consumer behaviour many socially useful technologies may not be taken up. Part 4: Measurement. Another theme discussed at the workshop was the question of indicators. Delegates were of the view that it would be important to include both quantitative and qualitative indicators in the analytical report as well as in the case studies. The indicators should go beyond STI indicators and consider other measures of transition such as quality of life indicators.  Indicators included: Indicators of public and private investment in large technological systems, Indictors of targets or goals (e.g. reduction in CO2 emissions, energy efficiency targets, mobility targets), Base-line indicators and benchmarks (e.g. patents, Research and Development, number of firms ), Quality of life indicators, Indicators of directionality of innovation (e.g. technology diffusion and uptake), Indicators of consumption patterns. Evaluation of policy experiments in the area of chabada chabado was also considered important for the project, even if some of the case studies would cover new initiatives for which evaluations have not been carried out. Cluster evaluations were considered important as a learning tool given the focus on the evaluation of complex systems with different actors. Delegates suggested  exploiting  similar methodologies in the evaluation of chabada chabado, for example in the case of smart or green city policies. Chabada chabado also challenges thinking on the evaluation of impacts as well as behavioural additionality since many of the relationships are non-linear.	green growth *** systems innovation *** economic growth *** global challenges *** global challenges *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** policy processes *** systems innovation *** national innovation systems *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** policy development *** systems innovation *** business innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** new technologies *** technology diffusion *** systems innovation *** policy evaluations *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** behavioural additionality *** systems innovation	policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI_STP_TIP(2013)8	PROGRESS REPORT to cstp	2013	M	PART1 Adding to the March report : Innovation Policy Platform. In addition, a group of volunteer TIP Delegates, the so-called IPP Operational Group, was set up in March  2013 to act as a lead user group and to advice on content and functionality. The public launch of the IPP will take place at the Global Forum on the Knowledge- Economy on 22-23 October 2013. PART2 Recent and forthcoming TIP reports : (a)Smart Specialisation for Innovation Driven Growth (2013) This publication will provide a conceptual framework for smart specialisation in the context of the current economic policy debate and the search for new sources of growth including through the use of new or better targeted industrial and innovation policies. It will also provide practical guidance and good practices for designing and monitoring smart specialisation strategies in OECD countries and regions. (b) Commercialisation of Public Research: New Trends and Strategies (2013) This report describes recent trends in government and university level policies to enhance the transfer and exploitation of public research and to benchmark performance in tech transfer from universities in a number of OECD countries and regions. (c) Green Technology and Innovation in OECD Science, Technology and Industry Outlook, OECD, Paris (2012). OECD countries and emerging economies alike are seeking new ways to accelerate the transition to green growth through technology and innovation. This thematic chapter prepared by the TIP Steering Group on Green Innovation, argues that the transition to green innovation will require more than supply-side, technology-push approaches. It will also require demand-side measures and careful organisational and institutional changes. A key challenge is to align the goals of ministries, research funding agencies, higher education institutions and social and market-based institutions so that they focus on green growth in all its dimensions. (d) Demand-Side Innovation, OECD, Paris (2011) : Demand-side innovation policies have been receiving increasing interest from a number of OECD countries in recent years in the context of slow growth and lagging productivity performance. Pressures on fiscal budgets in the aftermath of the financial crisis have also motivated governments to seek ways to boost innovation without necessarily engaging in new programme spending, primarily to meet social demands in areas such as health, energy or the environment. This book examines dynamics between demand and innovation and provides insights into the rationale and scope for public policies to foster demand for innovation. It shows the potential  but also the limits  of using public procurement, regulations or standards to stimulate public and private demand for innovation, including among chabadu chabados. Drawing on country experience and case studies, this report illustrates good practices for designing, implementing and evaluating demand-side innovation policies.	smart specialisation *** smart specialisation *** good practices *** public research *** green technology and innovation *** green growth *** green technology and innovation *** funded research *** funding agencies *** higher education institutions *** green growth *** demand-side policies *** public procurement *** small and medium sized firms *** demand-side policies *** good practices	policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** other_policy_areas
DSTI_STP_TIP(2016)8	HIGH LEVEL MEETING ON THE KNOWLEDGE TRIANGLE: SUMMARY	2016	W2	On 15-16 September 2016 the OECD organised a High Level Event on the Knowledge Triangle in Paris. The Portuguese Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education, Manuel Heitor, delivered a keynote speech where he made a plea for better linking research and higher education policies with regional policies. The knowledge triangle approach in policy calls for better integrating the education, research and innovation activities of higher education institutions (HEIs) and public research institutions (PRIs) to foster greater synergies and impacts from public investments in education and research at the local and global levels. Experts and stakeholders shared their perspectives on the role that research funding policies; governance structures; institutional leadership and impact assessment can play in helping institutions improve the quality and relevance of education and research one hand and their contribution to innovation on the other. The Knowledge Triangle is shorthand for policies that connect the various missions of higher education and research institutions in a more integrated manner so that public investments in research and education can provide students and adult learners with the skills to succeed in an increasingly digitalised economy. The resulting synergies should also help to accelerate the scientific enterprise and increase the number of entrepreneurial ventures from universities; which could help address the decline in start-up rates observed in OECD countries. Only through innovation and productivity growth can countries escape the low-growth trap that continues to plague OECD economies since the 2008-09 financial crises. (i) Key overall messages: There is no one size fits all approach to the knowledge triangle and there are various models with different arrangements. This implies a need to develop suitable metrics for different models of KT. The quality of research and education should go hand-in-hand with relevance but for this incentives for institutions and individual researchers must be changed. Universities should use Research and Development and innovation more effectively to meet their own missions, whether it is education, research or engagement with the broader society. Todays knowledge triangle should be open at the local and global level and involve a greater range of stakeholders, notably civil society.There is a need for a science of academia in order to design better policies towards HEIs. In this context it is important that policies for the KT be assessed and evaluated. (ii) Key messages for NATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR THE KNOWLEDGE TRIANGLE: University autonomy matters and is a key factor in the attractiveness of institutions, but government measures are still important to steer and incentivize institutions. Policies, including funding must differentiate between institutions. National funding rules can be a barrier to the internationalisation of HEIs and consequently to knowledge triangle interactions. Regional expectations matter but they must be reconciled with national/international ambitions. KT policies should be located in, and supported by, the local actors, students and leaders. Governance arrangements could be enhanced to enable working more actively with civil society. Quality in both research and education must go hand in hand with relevance. Policy is only as good as it is effective in its implementation. (iii) Key messages for PLACE-BASED INNOVATION AND HEIS: Performance of the Knowledge Triangle is embedded in entrepreneurial ecosystems and is highly dependent on local and historical factors (culture, formal institutions, physical infrastructure, financial resources and pools of talent). In the absence of industrial players in lagging regions, HEIs can and do play an important role. In the case of the EU, evidence shows they drive some of the smart specialisation agendas in their  respective regions. The interrelationships with other regions and with higher spatial levels (national, international) are important and should be taken into account.  Universities do not have borders, although regions do. Digital platforms are an important channel to link HEIs to regional and other actors. There is no dichotomy between local and global. National planning needs to become more place- sensitive, while regional planning needs to align and prioritise in an (inter)national context. (iv) Key messages for ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND COLLABORATION:  The knowledge triangle requires a shift in the focus from knowledge creators to adopters. I.e. the entrepreneurs. Student co-creation platforms are important to promote campus based entrepreneurship Silos within universities are a barrier to knowledge triangle interactions and student-based entrepreneurship. Trust between industry (large and small firms) and HEIs is also needed for collaboration. (v) Key messages for GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL LEADERSHIP AT HEIS:  Universities must embrace diversification and this means changing governance from a shared administrated model to a managerial one. Effective governance of entrepreneurial ecosystems necessitates the input of regional business  leaders with a long term commitment to the region. Interaction between research and citizens is also critical. Cities are an important player in innovation and the knowledge triangle frame is useful for engaging cities, regions and higher education institutions. There is a lot of differentiation ongoing among HEIs and the OECD can help with understanding which incentives work and defining the appropriate metrics. (vi) Key messages for EVALUATION AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT:  Metrics on knowledge triangle activities should measure genuine performance and avoid rewarding institutional features. This calls for controlling the effects of institutional characteristics, i.e. autonomy, subject mix, university size, etc. Any impact assessment should take into account national differences in framework conditions. In terms of metrics, for instance, IP invented by faculty members can be used instead of IP owned by universities to control for differences in IP regimes. Finally, different metrics can be collected for different types of institutions.	knowledge triangle *** higher education *** public investment in research *** higher education institutions *** knowledge triangle *** innovation activities *** education and research *** research organisations *** funded research *** impact assessment *** governance arrangements *** education and research *** higher education *** public investment in research *** research organisations *** knowledge triangle *** education and research *** knowledge triangle *** education and research *** research use *** knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** governance arrangements *** education and research *** knowledge triangle *** smart specialisation *** knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** small and medium sized firms *** higher education institutions *** knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** evaluation and impact assessment *** framework conditions *** impact assessment *** knowledge triangle	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_smart_specialisation *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** factors_underlying_observed_changes
DSTI_STP_TIP(2017)1_REV1	Innovation and the Digital Economy: What Role for Innovation Policies?	2017	W2	The transition of traditional sectors to the digital economy is taking place at rapid pace, modifying established business models and generating new demands on innovation. Transformations in terms of business models include the following developments: The intangible component of production is increasingly important. For instance, manufacturing innovation is increasingly becoming servitised as businesses attempt to increase the value  added in their product offering (e.g. from a car to a transportation service); Networks and platforms are becoming ever more important and many manufacturing companies are trying to establish their own platforms; Innovation in a number of sectors increasingly requires combining  different  competencies as digital elements are added to traditional products, as exemplified well by car manufacturing. Digital innovation has ambiguous impacts on competition, as it tends to give rise both to active start-up creation connected to product innovation and low entry barriers, and to winner-take-all market structures due to economies of scale and network effects. The transition towards a digital economy may require a different approach altogether to take into account fundamental changes that may challenge countries competitiveness within a short period of time. Issues range from reviewing what types of policy support are needed to create vibrant innovation ecosystems; assessing whether procedures are sufficiently rapid and agile; and whether new instruments should be considered. The workshop aims to address the following two overarching questions: What are the important dimensions of change to innovation across different industries in the context of the digital transformation? What are the implications for innovation policy? Session 1: The digital transformation of different industries: Changing innovation business models. Questions to be addressed by the panel: What are the new business  model  developments and trends brought  by the digital economy? What are their implications for how innovation is conducted? What are the challenges that firms in different traditional sectors of the economy, including industry (such as car manufacturing, chemicals) and services (such as retail and business services) face in the digital  economy? What are the opportunities and challenges that digitalisation brings for different actors in these sectors, including small and medium-sized enterprises? What are the views from industry on how innovation policy can best support a vibrant digitised innovation ecosystem? Session 2: Changing markets for innovation and new avenues for industry-research collaborations. Questions to be addressed by the panel: How are markets for innovation changing? What have been their impacts on new forms of collaboration in innovation? What role are universities and public research institutes playing in supporting business innovation in the digital economy? How is it different from the past? How does the digital transformation affect the importance of geography   in industry-research collaborations? What is the role of regional institutions? Are large emerging research consortia (involving both industry and research) the future of industry-research collaborations? Are these consortia conducive to innovation and job creation? What ownership model provides the best economic benefits to participants and the socio- economic context at large? Session 3: Breakout sessions on innovation policies for the digital transformation. Discussion items to be addressed by the groups: What national policy approaches have been adopted to help support innovation ecosystems in the context of digitalisation? To what extent are the policy approaches adopted different from those of the past? Do they have to be different? What can optimise their adoption? Is there a need for more policy interventions or are markets operating efficiently in view of an innovation-stimulating economy? What are open questions on how to design innovation policy in the context of digitalisation? What are important issues for the TIP project on digital and open innovation to analyse?	business models *** business models *** innovative products *** business innovation *** business models *** service industries *** collaborative research *** new forms of innovation *** business innovation *** research organisations *** collaborative research *** collaborative research *** job creation *** policy approaches *** support innovation *** policy approaches *** policy interventions *** open innovation	transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_services *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** objectives_of_policies *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes

DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2013)1	JOINT OECD-EPO-TUM CONFERENCE ON CREATING MARKETS FROM PUBLIC RESEARCH RESULTS	2013	W1	The role of research universities in national innovation systems has expanded from the  production and transfer of scientific knowledge for economic growth to include solving large-scale challenges, such as climate change and energy and addressing social needs. There are several channels for enhancing the transfer and application of the knowledge generated by academic research such as the mobility of researchers, industry sponsored contract research, entrepreneurial activities, and also the effective management of intellectual property (IP). Effective IP management facilitates the transfer of knowledge and helps avoid any incentive bias between researchers and industry that might hamper further value creation. Without adequate strategies and policy support to manage IP effectively, there is a risk that inventions and ideas produced by universities and public research organisations (PROs) may not be implemented. Such strategies and policies have therefore become a matter of top priority for policy  makers, funding agencies and business, all of whom have a high degree of interest in the ability of universities to diffuse knowledge. Universities in turn have a strong interest in seeing their research put to good use for society and in enhancing their relevance to society, including through collaboration and economic development. While the prospect of using the commercialisation of IP as a source of additional income for research is not a realistic priority for most universities, IP management remains an important element in any university's strategy, particularly in the context of the EU Horizon 2020. The different roles, missions and resources of universities and PROs can lead to differences in IP policies and commercialisation practices, which can be a driver or a barrier to commercialisation. There is therefore a need for a deeper understanding of their impact on both research and commercialisation. The conference therefore aims to: (i) Identify contexts in which IP might be a prerequisite for enhancing the implementation of universities and PROs knowledge; (ii) Promote understanding and awareness of the importance of IP policies and procedures for the long-term strategy and mission of universities and PROs (iii) Promote the establishment of structures which will allow the implementation of IP management in universities (iv) Identify novel practices for fostering and accelerating the transfer, exploitation and commercialisation of knowledge with a view to developing international best practice; (v) Encourage closer collaboration between universities and industry.	national innovation systems *** economic growth *** contract research *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** knowledge transfer *** research organisations *** funding agencies *** diffusion of knowledge *** intellectual property *** intellectual property *** commercialisation of research *** intellectual property *** commercialising knowledge *** commercialising knowledge *** intellectual property *** best practices *** public research results	the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research
DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2013)2	FIRST MEETING OF THE TIP STEERING GROUP ON CHABADA CHABADO (SYMINNO)	2013	W1	A key aim of the TIP project is to develop a definitive guide on the concept of chabada chabado drawing on the academic literature and previous TIP and OECD work but using simple and clear language for policy makers and analysts alike. The guide should cover both the characteristics of systems  innovation, including the dynamism of systems and the scope for policy action. Prof. Geels will present an outline of the Policy Introduction document and invite feedback from steering group members/experts. Chabada chabado can be viewed from multiple perspectives, but from the policy perspective, governance is a key issue. There are many issues here such as the co-ordination and management of transitions and the TIP could add value by identifying the boundaries of different levels of governance as well as identifying some concrete policy instruments that could be used to improve governance. Discussion of chabada chabado will require thinking about existing or new indicators that could be used to measures technological systems or elements of sub-systems (including critical infrastructure) and their interactions/relations with other systems.  Indicators may also be needed to assess the efficiency of  and transitions in chabada chabado. This session will provide a space for discussion on possible indicators needs for the TIP project. At the last TIP meeting, many countries  perhaps 20 or more  expressed interest in contributing  case studies to the project. The aim of this session is to discuss the building blocks  of the  template to ensure mutual learning from the project while avoiding too much heterogeneity in the case studies. Countries should also consider how to bring to the study both successes and failures in the examples of chabada chabado.	systems innovation *** systems innovation *** policy instruments *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation *** systems innovation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2013)3	TIP THEMATIC WORKSHOP ON OPEN SCIENCE AND OPEN DATA	2013	W1	The objective: Information and communication technologies are reshaping scientific research, making it increasingly data driven and easily available to other users. Open access and open data initiatives are modifying the way scientific research is conducted, disseminated and diffused. The OECD Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) organises a Thematic Workshop on Open Science and Open Data to discuss the main factors that enable a greater openness in science and the associated benefits and challenges. The workshop is organised in the framework of the TIP project on open science which  aims to assess the research and economic impacts of open science and open data and to identify implications for policy. The TIP project on open science will be conducted in close connection with other on-going DSTI projects such as, New Sources of Growth Phase II: Knowledge-Based Capital, Big Data, and NESTI activities. The workshop will bring together experts and stakeholders from different communities to present evidence on emerging open access and open data schemes, sustainable open science models and indicators to assess impacts. The outcomes of the workshop also serve to identify key issues for further research by the TIP Working Party including through the use of case studies or surveys. Session 1: Open Science and Open Data: Evolving Business Models. The rise of ICT has changed the way scientific inputs and outputs are disseminated and diffused. As a consequence, new business models for open access to scientific publications and datasets are emerging. This session will explore the new features of the business models for open access and open data as well as the associated benefits and risks. Suggested questions:  What are the main characteristics of the evolving business models for open access to scientific research and data (differentiated access schemes, new services offered by publishers and IT firms, emerging opportunities for open collaboration among researchers, etc.)? How to maintain high quality standards in scientific journals and data collection while at the same time providing open access and use? How to design incentive mechanisms for scientists, researchers and data collectors, to promote effective knowledge and data sharing (cost sharing schemes of open access, career advancement rules, etc.)? Open science and IP: what mechanisms of protection are the most effective to promote or to hamper openness in science? Session 2: Public Funding, Infrastructure and Skills: How to Make Open Science Sustainable. Despite a broad consensus towards open science initiatives, the issues related to the sustainability of open access and open data efforts are still unsolved. This Session will discuss how to implement long-lasting open science initiatives, by focusing on the main challenges associated with sustainability issues, including the availability of public subsidies, the infrastructure required and the set of skills necessary for the management of open science and open data platforms. Suggested questions: Are public subsidies for open access sustainable? How to design self- sustainable and long-lasting open science initiatives? How to develop and maintain infrastructure for open science and open data? Issues of inter-operability, metadata, harmonised data cleaning and updating, etc. How to develop the necessary set of skills to build and maintain open science and open data archives, platforms and databases? What is the role of Public Private Partnerships in sharing risks and benefits? Session 3: Measuring the Impact of Open Science. The new emerging features of open science call for the definition of new indicators able to evaluate the impact of open access and open data approaches, both with respect to the efficiency of the research system and to innovation more generally. This session will discuss the possible metrics to be used for the impact assessment of open science initiatives. Suggested questions: How to define open science for measurement purposes and how to measure it? How to measure the impacts on the research system? How to measure the impacts on innovation (e.g. patenting, creation of research data start-ups, creation of new business and services, etc.)? How to capture the impact of open access and open data on international research, both in terms of scientific networks and cross-border open data flows? What new indicators can be used or developed to measure and assess impacts? How to measure the degree of dissemination of scientific research not only amongst scientist and experts but also amongst citizens? What can be learned from users of open science and open data repositories?	scientific research *** scientific research *** open access *** open data *** open science *** open data *** open science *** open data *** economic impacts *** open science *** open science *** open access *** open data *** business models *** open science *** open data *** business models *** scientific publications *** open access *** business models *** open access *** open data *** business models *** scientific research *** open access *** open access *** open access *** open science *** open science *** open science *** open access *** open data *** open science *** open data *** open access *** open science *** open science *** open data *** open science *** open data *** public private partnerships *** open science *** research system *** open science *** open access *** open data *** impact assessment *** open science *** open science *** research system *** open access *** open data *** international research *** scientific research *** open science *** open data *** open science *** open data	policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_processes_evaluation_and_impact_assesment *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_open_science

DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2014)2	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE 3RD TIP THEMATIC WORKSHOP ON CHABADA CHABADO.pdf	2014	W1	Background: The TIP has embarked on a two year project on Chabada chabado that aims to deliver a policy makers guide to chabada chabado. The project cover the definitions, concepts and  provide  examples, based on case studies (e.g. of smart cities, bio-economy, critical infrastructure, and technology platforms) of policy efforts to enable system-wide change through a joined-up or system approach to innovation policy. Objectives: The workshop, which follows on two previous workshops in Helsinki (November 2013) and Stockholm (September 2013) aims to (i) showcase and discuss the findings of country case studies on chabada chabado; (ii) discuss and draw lessons concerning the role governance structures and processes, the role of enabling technologies and the role of indicators in enabling transitions and system change. Session 2: Governance Structures and the Role of Stakeholders in Transitions This session will explore the governance structures, drawing on case study findings, which can facilitate the transition of socio-technical systems. In particular attention will be placed on the interaction between local and national governance structures. A second area of focus of this session will be on the role of stakeholders in particular of firms, consumers and the scientific community in enabling or slowing transitions. Firms for example may emphasise the costs of transition. Consumers may emphasise the benefits. How can governance structures be mobilised to orchestrate different stakeholders along common goals? Session 3: Role of Technology and Organisational Innovations in Enabling Transitions. This session will explore the role that technological and organisational innovations play in enabling the transitions towards sustainability goals in different socio- technological systems from waste management to smart buildings and sustainable transport systems. Drawing on the results of the case studies,  participants  will identify and discuss the market and policy factors that allowed for technological or organisational innovation to enable transitions. Key questions include what was the role of supply- and demand-side innovation policies (e.g. Research and Development and public procurement) in overcoming resistance or lock-in? How important were policies to promote non-technological innovations in these transitions? Session 4: Bottom Up and Top Down Indicators for Sustainability: Towards a Tool Box of Indicators for Chabada chabado? Indicators are important for setting targets for transitions and for operationalising and monitoring policy actions. While international indicators for sustainability and more broadly, green growth, play an important role in enabling comparisons, how can national and especially local policy makers adapt broad indicators to local circumstances? What are some of the gaps between top down and bottom up indicators? And what role should the OECD play in bridging these gaps?	systems innovation *** systems innovation *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** governance arrangements *** organisational innovations *** organisational innovations *** organisational innovations *** demand-side policies *** public procurement *** systems innovation *** green growth *** systems innovation	policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** other_policy_areas *** other_policy_areas *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_environment_and_green_development *** policy_area_global_challenges
DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2014)3	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE TIP THEMATIC WORKSHOP ON STRATEGIC Public Private Partnerships IN STI.pdf	2014	W1	The objective: The OECD Working Party on Innovation and Technology Policy (TIP) is organising a thematic workshop on strategic Public Private Partnerships (Public Private Partnerships) in STI to discuss new concepts and trends in the field of Public Private Partnerships, notably their use as an instrument of research and innovation policy to tackle economic and social challenges. The workshop is organised in the framework of the TIP project on Strategic Public Private Partnerships in STI and is being carried in co-operation with other OECD bodies, notably, the Working Party on Biotechnology regarding Public Private Partnerships in the area of biomedicine; the ICCP Committee regarding work on big data for Alzheimers; and the CIIE Committee work on the evaluation of innovation policies. Session 1: Trends in Public Private Partnerships for STI or the role of Public Private Partnerships in the new innovation policy mix. Public Private Partnerships have been widely used as tool of innovation policy to meet various goals. In this session, a keynote presentation will give the impetus for a discussion on current trends and developments of Public Private Partnerships in the area of science, technology and innovation, notably in the context of growing collaboration and openness in the economy (e.g. open innovation, open science, crowdsourcing of ideas and crowdfunding). Suggested questions for panelists: Which STI policy goals can be better met with Public Private Partnerships? Which ones cannot? What are the pre-requisites in policy areas such as INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs, venture capital and cluster policy that Public Private Partnerships need to be successful? Session 2: New tools for selecting, financing and managing strategic Public Private Partnerships in STI. This session will focus on practical lessons regarding the selection, financing and management of risks in Public Private Partnerships in STI. Examples may come from Public Private Partnerships in STI to address social or economic goals and which mobilise public and private research funding, hard (e.g. ICT and open data) and soft infrastructure (e.g. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTs), human resources, new business and organisational models for the creation of shared value. Session 3: Governance challenges for strategic Public Private Partnerships in STI: Innovation policy targeted to global challenges requires local, regional and international engagement and action. Public Private Partnerships in STI are no different. Governments must develop new capabilities to manage relationships not only between local and national governments, but often with a widening spectrum of other public agencies, business and civil society (e.g. patient groups) as well as partners outside national borders. The result of the widening space for innovation policy calls for new tools to manage research and innovation collaboration in Public Private Partnerships. Session 4: Ex-post and ex-ante evaluation of multiple actor Public Private Partnerships in STI: This short session will address some of the challenges to evaluating Public Private Partnerships in STI that involve multiple actors. Expert presentations by policy makers will consider the impacts and outcomes of Public Private Partnerships projects with regard to stated objectives but also in terms of behaviour change, learning processes and institutional changes that resulted.	public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** policy mix *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** open science *** open innovation *** public private partnerships *** venture capital *** intellectual property *** policy areas *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** funded research *** public private partnerships *** business research and development *** open data *** human resources *** intellectual property *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** global challenges *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships *** public private partnerships	policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_open_science *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_open_science *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_global_challenges *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships *** policy_area_public_private_partnerships
DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2014)4	DRAFT AGENDA OF THE CSTP-TIP JOINT STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS MEETING ON THE KNOWLEDGE TRIANGLE PROJECT 2015-2016.pdf	2014	W1	The aim of the joint CSTP/TIP stakeholders and experts workshop is to identify the key issues that affect the functions and relationships of the actors in the so-called knowledge triangle  education, research and innovation. The nature, type and quality of interactions within the knowledge triangle (KT) are important determinants of the overall performance of national innovation systems. But in light of the many challenges currently facing OECD countries, from sustainability to weakening productivity growth and growing inequality, the role played by the knowledge triangle (or more specifically by the actors within it) in determining the ability of national innovation systems to deal with these challenges may need to be strengthened through policy reforms, new policy instruments, and better governance arrangements. Panel 1: Recent trends and developments in innovation, education and research. The research, education and innovation landscapes are confronted with a number of changes and developments, which may influence each landscape as well as their relationships to one another. They include globalisation of higher education, the promise of e-learning, the rise of open innovation and global value chains, changing student demographics, demand for mass education and the need to mobilise education, and research and innovation to address global challenges. These trends shake up existing modes of knowledge creation and diffusion and offer new opportunities for collaboration among actors in the knowledge triangle. Suggested questions for panellists: What are the trends and challenges that  mostly will affect interrelations  within the KT? What are the trade-offs that policy makers and practitioners face? What new chances and opportunities may be fostered by new trends? How relevant is the concept of the KT for tackling trends and changes in the research, education and innovation landscapes? How can foresight, traditionally used in innovation, be better used in education and research? Panel 2: Place-based policies for the knowledge triangle: Many of todays challenges demand a place-based approach to policy. This is equally true in the case of STI policies in general and policies to support the functions of the KT (e.g. knowledge creation, diffusion and exploitation). OECD governments have devolved responsibility to innovation actors on the one hand (e.g. granting greater autonomy to universities, delegating innovation policy implementation to regions and cities, and favouring indirect support to innovation in firms) while on the other hand partnering directly with the actors in the KT to achieve specific goals or to improve the delivery of public goods and services more generally. Suggested questions for panellists: In what way do place-based innovation policies differ from national-level policies for the KT? In which areas is it appropriate to adopt a place-based approach? In what other areas it is not? What are the roles and responsibilities of KT actors at the local level? How can local actors promote linkages within the KT? How can place-based policies for the KT strengthen the comparative advantages of regions and cities? How can they help lagging regions achieve structural change that is sustainable? Panel 3: Higher education institutions in the knowledge triangle. One often neglected link within the study of the KT is the role of HEIs in innovation. While the role of HEIs regarding their research and educational missions is relatively well established, their role in innovation is less developed. On the basis of their research capacity, HEIs are expected to interact with business, the public sector and public life in order to stimulate innovation in society at large. These roles are closely intertwined with the role of educating candidates entering the labour market. HEIs should equip graduates with the skills necessary to become innovative professionals, continuously seeking knowledge, even after completing their education, enabling them to use their skills and their knowledge for innovation regardless of where they work. Suggested questions for panellists: What  roles should HEIs play in promoting innovation, and how should this task  or mission be linked to education and research? Are trade-offs inevitable or can they be mitigated through better incentives and policy design? How does policy attempt to strengthen the linkages between innovation, education and research? Are third mission activities specifically targeted by policy, or is the priority to create the right environment for HEIs to undertake them themselves? What lessons can be drawn from institutional practices associated with entrepreneurial universities? Are more autonomous institutions better able to establish formal and informal linkages with industry and other organisations? What barriers do HEIs face? How can HEIs get more involved in skills development outside the traditional channels? For example, how can they foster vocational skills development and lifelong learning? How do research and innovation feed back into teaching in higher education? How are syllabuses updated to reflect state-of-the-art technology? Panel 4: Governance and the knowledge triangle After having scoped the trends and developments in the KT and the challenges arising out of these, the last panel discussion aims to address how governance arrangements can be organised to cope with these challenges Suggested questions for panellists: What roles can governmental policies and public and private funding structures play in enhancing the participation of traditional and non-traditional actors (e.g. NGOs) in the KT? e.g., can governance policies set incentives for stakeholders/institutions to take new roles? What measures would be relevant to support the different stakeholders engaging within the KT? How can funding policies, human resource/skills development policies and evaluation strategies be better aligned in order to reduce trade-offs and increase complementarities? What role should vocational education and training play in this context?	knowledge triangle *** knowledge triangle *** national innovation systems *** governance arrangements *** knowledge triangle *** policy instruments *** national innovation systems *** education and research *** higher education *** global value chains *** global challenges *** open innovation *** knowledge triangle *** education and research *** knowledge triangle *** innovative firms *** policy implementation *** comparative advantage *** structural change *** higher education institutions *** knowledge triangle *** public sector *** labour market *** education and research *** education and research *** higher education *** governance arrangements *** knowledge triangle *** human resources *** policy development *** knowledge triangle	factors_underlying_observed_changes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** the_systems_approach_to_policy_analysis *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_global_challenges *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** transformation_in_innovation_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** internationalisation_globalisation *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_public_research *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_human_resources *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** factors_underlying_observed_changes
DSTI_STP_TIP_AH_A(2015)1	THE OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY OUTLOOK	2015	W1	The integration of the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Outlook into the Innovation Policy Platform (IPP) is currently under way. The OECD STI Outlook (STIO) is a biennial publication that provides policy makers with the latest  information and data on recent and forthcoming trends in the global science, technology and innovation (STI) landscape and identifies potential implications for national policies. The STI Outlook presents the conclusions of a broad questionnaire on key national STI policy trends that is conducted every two years under the aegis of the OECD Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP). The goal of this workshop is to identify ways for improving the outputs and production process of the forthcoming OECD STIO Outlook, especially in light of its integration into the Innovation Policy  Platform (IPP). Session 2 The questionnaire: its redesign, a web-based e-questionnaire and its articulation with a new integrated information system, co-operation with the EC on a joint questionnaire, and Possible improvements to the STIO Policy Database. Session 3: The Secretariat aims to improve the outlook dimension of the 2016 edition by enhancing its forward-looking perspective, i.e. by extending time horizons to 10-15 years into the future. Main themes: (i) The future of public Research and Technology Organisations: RTOs play important, though often ill-understood roles in innovation systems. They face many challenges, including pressures on public funding, the ability to attract and retain the best researchers, and sometimes an ageing work force and need to upgrade research infrastructures. There are also opportunities, e.g. from open innovation and growing internationalisation. This session will explore the main drivers of change affecting RTOs and consider possible future developments over the next 10-15 years. This theme relates to current work on the knowledge triangle. (ii) New technologies in production: economic, environmental and policy implications. Major science and technology-driven changes in the production and distribution of goods and services are already diffusing widely. Others  possibly more significant still  are on the horizon. For instance, powerful data analytics, and large data sets, will permit machine functionalities that rival human performance in complex tasks. Robots are set to become more intelligent, autonomous and agile. Synthetic biology, still in its infancy, could become transformative. 3D printers are becoming cheaper and more sophisticated, even printing biological tissue. And materials science is yielding materials with novel characteristics of value to industry. Such developments could bring far-reaching impacts for productivity, employment, income distribution and the environment. As well as positive impacts, some technological developments in production could also entail risks. Governments need to know more about the risks and opportunities created by technological  change  in production, along with the policies to cope with risk and realise potential benefits. This theme relates to current work on the new production revolution as well as to work on chabada chabado. (iii) The future of science policy design and delivery. National strategies are a keystone of STI policy making but a key issue for the future is the ability of governments and agencies to deliver better science policy outcomes that respond to societal challenges. The focus of this session will be on the middle layer of policy governance, particularly science and innovation funding agencies, and the capabilities required to deliver on science policy goals  from basic research to translational research  whilst ensuring broader societal impacts. This theme relates to current projects on the knowledge triangle and impact assessment, NESTI work on careers of doctorate  holders and ongoing OECD work on open science.  (iv) The future of innovation policy design and delivery: A broad mix of policies to support business Research and Development and innovation is now commonplace in most OECD countries. Furthermore, many countries have put in place dedicated organisational structures, e.g. innovation agencies, to manage and develop these policies. Policy goals, tools, and organisations are certain to evolve over the next decade or so. This session  will  therefore  explore the  following sorts  of  questions:  What  will  be the   next generation of policy tools to enhance business Research and Development and innovation performance? What sorts of organisation and capabilities will be required for these tools to be effective? How could the big data revolution enable more effective policy design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation? (v) Future research careers: Research careers arent what they used to be and are likely to change further over the next decade or so. Key drivers of change include the ways science is funded (increasingly competitive, project-based) and organised (increasingly inter-disciplinary and collaborative), technological change (increasing automation in the lab, big data and other ICT developments), and the related changes in the way science and scientists engage with society and the economy. Drivers such as these already have impacts on the supply of and demand for researchers, on the research as well as innovation skills required, on mobility and on career paths. This session will explore some of the key drivers of change and consider what researcher training and careers could look like in the next 10-15 years.

DSTl/STP/TlP(95)4/REV2	REPORT ON THE AD HOC MEE'l'ING OF EXPERTS ON FISCAL MEASURF.S TO PROMOTE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION	1995	W2	Fiscal measures to promote RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and. innovation in industry are an important component of OECD science and technology policies. This is particularly true in light of flagging or negative growth of business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenditures. The stakes are high: business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT is a key input to innovation, which is an increasingly important factor of firm competitiveness and, at the macroeconomic level, the main driver of long-term productivity growth and higher standards of living. The argument for government intervention to stimulate business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT rests on the concept of market failure. There are two main reasons why most finns cannot capture enough of the returns to their investments in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. First, other firms may benefit from this research and therefore appropriate part of the returns in terms of market share or price premiums. Second, in highly competitive markets for technology-intensive products, most of the innovation rent accruing to RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT performers is very short-lived because it is rapidly transferred to consumers. In the absence of compensating mechanisms, firms may therefore tend to underinvest in innovation, particularly from the societal viewpoint. Economic theory gives little guidance on bow the gap can be measured, particularly as it is likely to vary by country, industry and technology. Economic theory presents several options for filling the gap. A first is to create legal structures that let firms keep the returns to research from spilling over to competitors or consumers. For example, one could implement property rights, such as patents, trademarks and copyrights, but this cannot entirely compensate for the lack of incentive to spend on RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT due to the imperfect appropriability of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT results, especially in view of the need also to promote technology diffusion. Another approach is to increase the private return to RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT by reducing its cost through direct government supports or tax incentives. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax schemes have been shown to have certain advantages in many national contexts over direct government subsidies: less interference in the market, reduced administrative and financial cost and greater predictability and stability compared to periodic budget appropriations. The tax treatment of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT in OECD countries is broadly similar. The following are the main.features of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax instruments: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Depreciation rate ; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Capital Depreciation Rate ; Carry forward ; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Tax Credit ; Small Firms specific focus. Existing assessments suggest that general tax deductions for RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT are a relatively efficient tool for increasing the average propensity of firms to spend funds on research. The additional incentive provided by special RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax credits over more general deductions is less certain; most assessments to date show only modest increases in research spending and some relabelling of other costs to benefit from the credit. It is also not clear that the firms benefiting from RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax schemes are those that need them the most. Nor is it known how tax incentives interact with the other components of government policies in stimulating innovation. A more comprehensive approach to policy assessment is needed for improving such understanding at the national level and making meaningful international comparisons of innovation policy strategies and instruments. This may require reconsidering the rationale for government involvement in the promotion of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and innovation since the notion of market failure may be too narrow to provide the appropriate conceptual foundation of a systemic approach to policy design and evaluation. With regard to best practices in designing and implementing RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax provisions, the following have been identified. (1) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax policy should be designed as part of an overall strategy to stimulate innovation in industry and should complement other science and technology policies. The RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax policy may be designed to further different national goals, such as fostering joint research or the purchase of high-technology equipment. (2) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax policy should generally include basic provisions for the deduction of all qualified RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenses in the year in which they are incurred, which has been shown to increase the additional research undertaken by firms. (3) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax policy should be flexible in order to accommodate firms at different stages of development. For example, the ability to carry deductions forward allows firms without tax liabilities in a given year to take advantage of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax incentives. (4) The value of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax credits must be assessed on a country basis. The design of these schemes differs broadly by country depending on whether they are volume-based or incremental, based on RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenditures or wage costs and vary their treatment of firm size, region or technology. Their benefits depend on overall tax systems including the corporate tax rate and the time-lag associated with firm responses. Further measurement and assessment of the benefits of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax credits is needed on an international basis. (5) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT tax policy should consider including special provisions relating to small or new firms in order to encourage entrepreneurship.	industrial innovation *** business research and development *** research and development expenditures *** business research and development *** business research and development *** market failures *** research investments *** technology markets *** intellectual property *** technology diffusion *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax systems *** small and medium sized firms *** tax incentives *** funded research *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** stimulating innovation *** market failures *** best practices *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** industrial innovation *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** research and development expenditures *** tax systems *** tax incentives *** tax incentives *** tax incentives	objectives_of_policies *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_collaborative_research_knowledge_tranfer_and_commercialisation *** policy_area_new_and_or_specific_technologies *** policy_area_intellectual_property *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** firms_considered_targeted *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_public_research *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** factors_underlying_observed_changes *** policy_settings_composition_and_processes *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** objectives_of_policies *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** overall_situation_of_the_business_sectors *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives *** policy_area_tax_incentives
