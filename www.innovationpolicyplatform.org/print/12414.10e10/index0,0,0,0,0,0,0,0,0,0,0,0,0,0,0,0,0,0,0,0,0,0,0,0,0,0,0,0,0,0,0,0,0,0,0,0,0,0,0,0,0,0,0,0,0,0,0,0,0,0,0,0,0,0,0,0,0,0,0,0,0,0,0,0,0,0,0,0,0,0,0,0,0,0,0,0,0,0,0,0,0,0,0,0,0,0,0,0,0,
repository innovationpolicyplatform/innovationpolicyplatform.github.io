Lack of finance typically prevents new ventures from investing in innovative projects, improving their productivity, financing their growth, covering working capital requirement and meeting market demand.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>Research supports the relevance of access to finance as a key determinant of entrepreneurship</strong> and clearly identifies a finance gap in many locations for new and small firms involved in the early stages of innovation, especially in the market for high risk capital.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>The importance of different types of finance varies across the stages of business development</strong>. During the seed and start-up stages, technology-driven high-growth SMEs can obtain equity financing from entrepreneurs or from family and friends. In earlier stages, self-financing is particularly important since innovative entrepreneurs cannot overcome information asymmetry and therefore rarely find any lender or investors, even for potentially profitable projects. Subsequently, financing may be supplemented by seed capital investment from informal private investors (e.g. business angels) and, in a few cases, by seed financing funds and venture capitalists. In the expansion stage, SMEs generally require increasing amounts of equity to maintain R&amp;D and to expand marketing and sales activities, amounts that are typically only available through other sources, such as initial public offerings on stock exchanges.</div>

          <div class="field-item even"><div style="text-align:justify">
<ul><li>The main rationale is that profitable investments in innovative and entrepreneurial activities are liquidity constrained due to capital market imperfections. Small and new ventures are particularly affected by these capital market imperfections. The difficulties that innovative entrepreneurs experience stem from several sources: they typically lack collateral and a track record, they are involved in innovation processes whose outcomes are uncertain, they deal with a public good (knowledge), whose return on investment is not predictable and they own assets whose nature may be intangible and difficult to evaluate (e.g. patents). The smaller and younger the business, the more opaque the information on its business performance and financial solidity will be.</li>
</ul></div>
<div style="text-align:justify">
<ul><li>Insufficiently developed financial markets might be a further systemic failure affecting access to finance for innovative entrepreneurs, but one that only coordinated efforts can address (e.g. by supporting the creation of financial markets where IP assets can provide access to funding).</li>

<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>Debt financing</strong> (<span>see <a href="../../content/debt-financing/index-2.html?topic-filters=12217" target="_blank">Debt financing</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></span>) by:</div>

<div style="text-align:justify">
<ul><li>guaranteeing part of the losses caused by the potential default of the borrower (e.g. mutual credit guarantee programs)</li>
</ul></div>
<div style="text-align:justify; padding-left:30px">By guaranteeing part of the losses caused by the potential default of the borrower, they increase the incentive for banks to engage in SME lending. Generally, credit guarantees see the involvement of three parties: the bank, the borrowing firm and the public authority providing the guarantee. A variant consists in mutual guarantee schemes, where an SME association typically provides a first-level guarantee on the loan of one its members, with the public sector covering an additional share of the loan.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">
<ul><li><span>offering credit mediation to companies in the case of a loan rejection</span></li>
</ul></div>
<div style="text-align:justify; padding-left:30px">Credit mediation occurs when governments appoint mediators to help SMEs deal with loan rejections. Through discussion, exchanging information, assistance in improving business plans and other techniques, credit mediators bridge the information gap between entrepreneurs and loan officers. This policy tool has been recently tested in France, Italy and Belgium.</div>
<ul><li><span>subsidising loans directly (e.g. through the intermediation of a national development bank)</span></li>
</ul><ul><li>supporting alternative types of debt finance, such as convertible loans and subordinated loans (e.g. through fiscal incentives to lenders and the partial coverage of losses in case of bankruptcy)</li>
