Beyond </span><span>subject-specific expertise, education should also develop students’ creativity, critical thinking, entrepreneurship </span><span>and communication skills. Doing so ultimately depends on pedagogical approaches and the design of curricula. </span><span>Many disciplines are relevant. A key principle should be the creation of an environment that enables </span><span>individuals to choose and acquire appropriate skills and supports the optimal use of these skills at work. The </span><span>OECD’s 2013 Skills Strategy sets out a comprehensive approach to develop skills and put them to best use.</span></div>

<div>In the workplace, possible policy avenues to support firm-level training include improving information <span>about training opportunities, setting legal frameworks so that private parties can organise and finance their </span><span>training (e.g. through contracts), and increasing the portability of skills by improving information on the </span><span>competencies and skills that are gained through various learning channels. Reinforcing public funding of </span><span>vocational education and training, and tax incentives to promote training, can be used as supplementary </span><span>measures. However, policy measures must take into account the implications that the "poaching" of workers </span><span>subsequent to training has for firms' willingness to undertake such investments. </span></div>

          <div class="field-item even"><div><span>On average across countries, roughly one-third of workers report a mismatch between their existing skills and </span><span>those required for their job, implying they are either over- or under-skilled. This mismatch also represents a </span><span>barrier to the growth of innovative firms. Making the most of the available skills in the economy requires </span><span>reforms to policies that restrict worker mobility, and funding for lifelong learning.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Women must also have equal opportunities to contribute to innovation. Governments should strive to ensure <span>that barriers to women’s participation in science, innovation and entrepreneurship are removed. Gender </span><span>stereotypes and non-transparent nomination and appointment procedures can all hinder female involvement. </span><span>Showcasing successful women in science and technology, and in high-growth firms, can provide useful role </span><span>models for young women who may not otherwise consider such fields. Removing gender biases and fostering </span><span>the participation of women is not only important for equality, but can also improve research and innovation itself.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span>Policy should also facilitate the development of linkages and networks among researchers and innovators </span><span>across countries. The knowledge embodied in people is the object of strong global competition, but OECD </span><span>research shows that knowledge flows across countries are circular. Policies should therefore not be based on </span><span>a view that international mobility entails zero-sum competition. Collaboration between countries often results </span><span>in better outcomes. A key consideration is that migration regimes for the highly skilled should be efficient, </span><span>transparent and simple, enabling movement on a short-term basis.</span></div>
