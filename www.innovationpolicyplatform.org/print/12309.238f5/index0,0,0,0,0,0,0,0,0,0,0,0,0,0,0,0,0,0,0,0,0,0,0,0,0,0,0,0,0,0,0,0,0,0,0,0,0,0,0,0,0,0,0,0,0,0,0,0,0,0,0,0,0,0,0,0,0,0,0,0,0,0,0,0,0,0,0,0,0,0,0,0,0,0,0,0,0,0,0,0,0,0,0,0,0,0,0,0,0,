<div> </div>
<div>Biotechnology today is used in primary production, health and industry. Platform technologies such as genetic modification, DNA sequencing, bioinformatics and metabolic pathway engineering have commercial uses in several application fields. The main current uses of biotechnology in primary production are for plant and animal breeding and diagnostics, with a few applications in veterinary medicine. Human health applications include therapeutics, diagnostics, pharmacogenetics to improve prescribing practices, functional foods and nutraceuticals, and some medical devices. Industrial applications include the use of biotechnological processes to produce chemicals, plastics, and enzymes, environmental applications such as bioremediation and biosensors, methods to reduce the environmental effects or costs of resource extraction, and the production of biofuels. Several applications, such as biopharmaceuticals, in vitro diagnostics, some types of genetically modified crops, and enzymes are comparatively “mature” technologies. Many other applications have limited commercial viability without government support (e.g. biofuels and biomining) or are still in the experimental stage, such as regenerative medicine and health therapies based on RNA interference.</div>

As a generic technology, research in biotechnology creates tools and inventions with multiple uses. The applications of biotechnology expand from primary production, to health and industry, and could result in the emergence of a “bioeconomy” where biotechnology contributes to a significant share of economic output.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Biotechnology can help to improve the supply and environmental sustainability of food, feed and fibre production, improve water quality, provide renewable energy, improve the health of animals and people, and help maintain biodiversity by detecting invasive species. Yet biotechnology is unlikely to fulfil its potential without appropriate regional, national and, in some cases, global policies to support its development and application.</div>

          <div class="field-item even"><div>In the mid 2000s, biotechnology probably contributed to less than 1% of GDP in the OECD countries. In contrast, the potential economic value of biotechnology is much greater than this. In 2004, primary production, health and industrial sectors that either used biomass or applied biotechnology accounted for 5.6% of the GDP of the European Union and 5.8% of the GDP of the United States.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Research in biotechnology has advanced rapidly since the early biotechnology discoveries of the mid-1970s. Industrial biotechnology has achieved spectacular new growth and interest in recent years, mainly as a result of global interest in biofuels. Research in biomedical and health innovation has generated knowledge, tools and techniques that have vastly improved the drug research and development process. Despite the tremendous advances in knowledge and technology, many developments remain “emergent” in the sense that they have not yet been translated or fully integrated into industrial processes, healthcare systems and medical practice.</div>
