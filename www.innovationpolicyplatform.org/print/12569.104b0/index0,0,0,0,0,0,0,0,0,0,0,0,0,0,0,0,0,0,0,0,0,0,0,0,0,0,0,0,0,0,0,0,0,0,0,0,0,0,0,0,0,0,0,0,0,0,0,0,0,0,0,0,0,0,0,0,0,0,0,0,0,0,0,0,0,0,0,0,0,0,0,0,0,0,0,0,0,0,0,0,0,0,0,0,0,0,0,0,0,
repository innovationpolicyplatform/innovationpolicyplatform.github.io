A combination of higher opportunities for career progression and research, a higher salary, and better working conditions should facilitate the recruitment and attraction of young or talented researchers, thus increasing the quality of research outcomes. The great majority of doctorate holders are working at universities and PRIs, while the business sector employs over half of the researcher population in most OECD countries. Although doctorate holders represent a crucial human resource for research and innovation, and benefit from an employment premium and a higher international mobility, evidence shows that they encounter some difficulties in the labour market, notably in terms of working conditions. Indeed, universities and PRIs may encounter several difficulties in recruiting both young researchers with high potential and experienced researchers, due to such factors as low starting pay, limited material rewards at senior levels compared with other professions, little wage differentiation between cohorts, a resistance to training in broader teaching or managerial skills, and difficulties in moving institutionally and internationally because of tenure, pension rights, and attitudes toward movement and job changes. In this frame, public policy will mainly aim at developing pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives for research careers, facilitating the hiring of talented young or experienced researchers at universities and PRIs, improving the working conditions for researchers, developing mobility and lifelong training schemes, and improving the research funding and infrastructure for researchers at universities and PRIs.</span></div></div>

The presence of talented and/or promising researchers should positively affect the performance of research activities, notably in terms of publications, “proof of concept” related activities, or in terms of teaching and research activities. Good working conditions, for example, in the form of high-quality research infrastructure, are an important consideration and can also enhance opportunities for R&amp;D collaborations with other research organisations and firms. </div>

          <div class="field-item even"><h5><strong>What is the evidence on research careers, pay and conditions?</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The great majority of doctorate holders are working in the public sector, particularly in universities, while the business sector employs more than half of the research population in the OECD area (Auriol, 2010; OECD, 2011). Although doctorate holders represent a crucial human resource for research and innovation, and benefit from an employment premium and a higher international mobility, evidence shows that they encounter some difficulties in the labour market, notably in terms of working conditions. Satisfaction levels in aspects other than pay are particularly high for individuals working in the higher education sector. The vast majority of doctorate holders feel more satisfied with those criteria linked to the content of the work (intellectual challenge, level of responsibility, degree of independence and contribution to society) than with those related to employment conditions (salary, benefits, job security, location and opportunities for advancement) (Auriol, 2007). Moreover, the figure below reveals that in most countries for which information is available, doctoral graduates are better paid when they do not work as researchers, especially outside the enterprise sector (OECD, 2010).&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Source: OECD/UIS/Eurostat CDH data collection 2009, in OECD 2010 (p. 51).</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Reading: In the United States, doctorate holders earn 12% more when they do not work as researchers, except in the business sector, where as researchers they earn 4% more than non-researchers.</h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Universities and PRIs may encounter several difficulties in recruiting young researchers with high potential or experienced researchers, due to such factors as low starting pay, limited material rewards at senior levels compared with other professions, little wage differentiation between cohorts, strong specialisation by field of research, a resistance to training in broader teaching or managerial skills, and difficulties in moving institutionally and internationally because of tenure, pension rights, and attitudes toward movement and job changes. Working conditions, employment structures and a decline in the linear career track for academics greatly affect the attractiveness of research careers (OECD, 2011). Despite these observations and as shown by the figure below, temporary positions appear to be increasingly common in the academic sector (Careers of Doctorate Holders, project report 2013, Auriol et al., 2013).&nbsp;</div>

<div>Regarding the mobility of doctorate holders, evidence shows that 15% to 30% in European countries have experienced mobility over the past ten years and that mobility may be increasing. However, mobility is more frequent among doctorates not working in research. Mobility of doctorate holders is driven by a variety of motives, including such factors as the end of the post-doc or job contract, returning to the home country, job or economic factors, academic factors (i.e. better possibilities to publish, possibility of creating their own research team or new research area), family reasons, personal reasons and political reasons (Auriol 2010; Auriol et al., 2013; Careers of Doctorate Holders project report 2013).</div>

          <div class="field-item even"><p><span>The importance of a strong research base and a high-quality research workforce to countries' innovation performance has led several governments to design a wide range of incentives for research careers and researchers. Beyond improving information on research careers, labour market opportunities and prospects for researchers, public policies related to research careers, pay and conditions mainly aim at improving the attractiveness of research careers, at enhancing pay and working conditions, and at providing appropriate support for the mobility of university and PRI researchers.</span></p>
<p>To achieve these goals public policies may:</p>
<ul><li><span>improve the employment and working conditions of researchers at universities and PRIs (e.g. increase earnings and social benefits, improve  pension and health insurance schemes, provide more adequate R&amp;D infrastructure, reduce the time allocated to administrative tasks, etc.), </span></li>

</ul><ul><li><span>support lifelong training schemes for researchers from universities and PRIs,</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>support top research teams and individuals, and fund excellence in research at universities/PRIs (e.g. through awards and prizes). However, this should not reduce the necessary support for broad-based research capacity and for new and emerging areas,</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>enhance financial support for the recruitment of young and promising or talented researchers, or ease the entrance conditions of young or foreign researchers (e.g. ease labour market regulation, simplify  recruitment procedures), </span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>favour systematic open recruitment and ensure non-discriminative recruitment procedures for women at universities and PRIs,</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>enlarge research opportunities (e.g. through R&amp;D funding, opportunities for greater participation in leading or large-scale research projects, etc.) and career progression prospects for trained researchers at universities/PRIs,</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>ensure a proper balance between the supply and demand of researchers, and an adequate provision of R&amp;D infrastructures at universities and PRIs, in order to ensure a more efficient use of human resources for research.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>Regarding the mobility of researchers, public policies may:</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>reduce institutional and financial barriers to the mobility of researchers and doctorate students, and design  funding for different forms of mobility oriented to individuals, including short-term mobility options, </span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>meet the social security and supplementary pension needs of mobile researchers from  universities and PRIs.</span></li>
