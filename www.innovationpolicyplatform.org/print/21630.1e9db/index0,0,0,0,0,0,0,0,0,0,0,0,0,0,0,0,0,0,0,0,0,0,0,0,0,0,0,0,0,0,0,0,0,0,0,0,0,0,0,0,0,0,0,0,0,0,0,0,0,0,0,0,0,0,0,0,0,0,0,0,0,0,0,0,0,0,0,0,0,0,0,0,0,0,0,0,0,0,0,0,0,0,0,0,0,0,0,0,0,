Public funding is needed to address the inherent under-investment in basic research of </span><span>private firms, linked to the large knowledge spillovers of such research. Long-term funding for curiosity-</span><span>driven research must be preserved, as this has been the source of many significant innovations in the past </span><span>and has high social returns, while project-based funding can allow for more direct steering of public </span><span>research towards major public policy objectives, complementing private research spending. A long-term and </span><span>stable perspective for public research funding is essential; focusing on short-term results will put the future </span><span>seeds of innovation at risk. While public budgets for R&amp;D have held up well since the crisis in most OECD </span><span>countries (Figures 1 and 2), they are now declining in several.</span></div>

    <div class="field-items">
          <div class="field-item even"><div>Rising international connectedness and the key role of multinational firms in driving frontier R&amp;D imply <span>that the benefits from public basic research and support to private R&amp;D will become more widespread</span></div>
<div>globally. This may weaken incentives for national governments to support these activities while at the same <span>time pushing them to compete to attract mobile investments by MNEs. Thus, global cooperation on research </span><span>– i.e. joint funding and mechanisms to facilitate cross-border and cross-field collaboration – will become </span><span>increasingly important. Developing effective science and technology initiatives at the global level requires </span><span>responsive and adaptable modes of governance, combined with flexible funding and spending mechanisms.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Governments continue to stimulate R&amp;D either directly through contracts, grants and awards or indirectly <span>through R&amp;D tax credits. A focus on high social returns and international good practices is essential. R&amp;D </span><span>tax incentives should be designed to also meet the needs of young, innovative firms and avoid amplifying </span><span>resource losses from cross-border tax planning. R&amp;D tax incentives are often unsuitable for young firms, as </span><span>they often not yet generated taxable income, and therefore cannot benefit, despite their particular strengths </span><span>as R&amp;D performers (e.g. in creating radical innovations) and job creators. Good design of tax credits through </span><span>cash refunds, carry forwards, or other approaches can address this problem. Governments should also </span><span>ensure that R&amp;D tax incentives are predictable for firms, and avoid tinkering with them repeatedly to </span><span>minimise policy uncertainty. Governments should systematically evaluate tax relief measures to assess </span><span>whether their targeting and design remain appropriate.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span>Policymakers should also balance indirect support for business R&amp;D (fiscal incentives) with direct support for </span><span>innovation. Direct support measures – e.g. contracts, grants, awards for mission-oriented R&amp;D or support for </span><span>networks – can be particularly effective for young firms that lack the upfront funds or collateral to finance an </span><span>innovative project. Any allocation of direct support should be competitive and based on objective and transparent </span><span>criteria. Selection processes must be designed to ensure efficiency (including minimal bureaucracy), avoid rent-</span><span>seeking (especially by vested interests) and support challengers (e.g. young firms). Non-financial support measures, </span><span>e.g. training, mentoring and network development, including for SMEs, are an important component of the overall </span><span>policy mix, as lack of funding is only one of the barriers that hold back innovation. Across all innovation </span><span>policies, well-designed public-private partnerships are increasingly important to help lever government funding.</span></div>

          <div class="field-item even"><div>Almost no business today is run without the help of ICTs. In 2014, almost 95% of enterprises in the OECD <span>area had a broadband connection. However, only 21% of firms in the OECD area conduct e-sales, and only </span><span>22% using cloud computing services (Figure 3). Overall, differences among countries in the use of various ICT </span><span>technologies remain considerable. This is closely, but not exclusively, related to differences in the share of </span><span>smaller firms across countries.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the same time, the growing number of computer-mediated transactions and the accelerating migration of <span>social and economic activities to the Internet are contributing to the generation of a huge volume of (digital) </span><span>data – commonly referred to as “big data”. Big data are now used by organisations, often in highly creative </span><span>ways, to generate innovations in products, processes, organisational methods and markets. However, the </span><span>use of big data creates several for governments. Governments will need to foster investments in broadband, </span><span>smart infrastructure and the Internet of Things as well as in data and analytics, with a strong focus on SMEs </span><span>and high value-added services. Promoting skills and competences in data analytics is also important. </span><span>Moreover, removing unnecessary barriers to the development of the Internet of Things, such as sector-</span><span>specific regulations, can help ensure its impact across the economy.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>An open and accessible Internet, with high fixed and mobile bandwidth, is essential for innovation in the <span>21st century. The Internet has become a platform for innovation thanks to its end-to-end connectivity and lack </span><span>of gatekeepers, providing a place where creativity, the exchange of ideas, entrepreneurship and experimentation </span><span>can flourish. Furthermore, an open Internet enables the management of GVCs, in which companies </span><span>increasingly spread production internationally. Governments need to strike the right balance between the </span><span>social benefits of openness and private preferences for a less open system, however. It will be particularly </span><span>important to preserve the open Internet and promote the free flow of data across the global ecosystem. At </span><span>the same time, governments will need to address individuals’ concerns about privacy violations and also </span><span>promote a culture of digital risk management across society. Finally, to ensure the digital economy is </span><span>inclusive, governments need to assess market concentration and address barriers to competition.</span></div>
