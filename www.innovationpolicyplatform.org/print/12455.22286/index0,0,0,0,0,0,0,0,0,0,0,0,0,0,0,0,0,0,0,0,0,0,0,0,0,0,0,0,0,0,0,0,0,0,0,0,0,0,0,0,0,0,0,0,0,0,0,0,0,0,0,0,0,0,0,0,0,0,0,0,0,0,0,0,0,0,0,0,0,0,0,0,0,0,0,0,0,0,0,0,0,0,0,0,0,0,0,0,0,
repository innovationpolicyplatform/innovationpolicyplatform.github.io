This in turn depends on factors ensuring “legal quality”. For patents, utility models, registered industrial design and plant variety, the following conditions characterise legal quality: (1) certainty of legal provisions and the IP examination process, (2) stability over time, (3) clarity, and (4) a reasonable inventive step. In the case of trademarks and geographical indications, certainty of the IP examination process and stability are the key components of legal quality. For unregistered industrial design rights, copyright and trade secrets, it is essentially the certainty over legal provisions and stability that will be critical.</div></div>

In the case of patents, legal certainty is about clear legal provisions regarding subject matter, duration, scope and breadth, inventive step, disclosure requirements. It also requires objective, high-quality and timely IP examination procedures and enforcement: that is, the IP examination process has to be applied within a reasonable time period using standardised criteria and decide on IP titles efficiently and in such a way that a low proportion of IP titles are rejected in courts.</span></li>

<div style="text-align:justify">In the case of trademarks and geographical indications, certainty of the IP examination process and stability are the key components of legal quality.
