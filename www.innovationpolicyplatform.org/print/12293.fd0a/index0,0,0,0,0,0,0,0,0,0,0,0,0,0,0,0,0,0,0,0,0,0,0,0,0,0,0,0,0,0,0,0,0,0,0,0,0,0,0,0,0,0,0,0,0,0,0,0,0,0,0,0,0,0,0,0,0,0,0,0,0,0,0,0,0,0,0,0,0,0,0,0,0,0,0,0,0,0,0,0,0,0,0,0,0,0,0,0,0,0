Skilled labour, in particular, is essential for innovative businesses, since innovation is a key driver of their success. Moreover, high labour costs or cumbersome hiring and firing conditions can adversely affect innovation in firms by reducing flexibilities with regards to employment.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>The challenge of accessing to labour can be particularly difficult for innovative start-ups for the following reasons:</strong></div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<ul style="text-align:justify"><li><strong>SMEs are found to suffer disproportionately from a lack of available qualified personnel</strong>, compared with their larger counterparts.</li>
</ul><ul style="text-align:justify"><li><strong>The administrative burdens of employment are relatively larger for smaller businesses</strong>, since expansion is often riskier for new ventures. This can have distorting effects on competition and divert human and financial resources away from business activity. However, the empirical evidence on the direct effects of employment protection legislation (EPL), on type of administrative burden, on entrepreneurship is mixed. </li>

These norms and procedures determine the efficiency of the labour market (for example, some factors discourage employment, as when companies subcontract rather than take people on as employees) and key costs related to expansion. These norms and procedures can also create barriers to entry and in this way affect market competition.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Strengthening lifelong education and training for innovation (e.g. raising attainment levels and the general quality of education, and introducing innovative learning practices into traditional disciplines).</li>
</ul><ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Strengthening an innovation culture and raising public interest in science and technology (S&amp;T), in order to attract young people to pursue higher education in S&amp;T disciplines (e.g. through large public communication and joint research projects involving youth and senior scientists).</li>

</ul><ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Supporting existing migrant entrepreneurs’ businesses and already established migrant entrepreneurs in host countries by increasing their human and social capital. Measures may include providing training, guidance and mentoring, and improving their network-building capacity. Strengthening networking between entrepreneurs and intermediary agencies may contribute to improving the effectiveness of such support measures.</li>
</ul><ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Facilitating access to credit by migrant entrepreneurs. Migrant entrepreneurs face greater problems accessing financing than native entrepreneurs. One explanation is that migrant enterprises typically lack a credit history due to their shorter existence and because credit histories are often not recognized across borders. This lack of credit history makes it more difficult for banks to assess the creditworthiness of migrant entrepreneurs. To overcome this problem, governments could implement bilateral and multilateral agreements to improve the exchange of credit information at global, regional and bilateral levels.</li>
</ul><div style="padding-left:30px; text-align:justify">Another obstacle is that credit institutions often lack understanding of migrant entrepreneurs, perceiving them as high-risk borrowers. Governments could mitigate this problem by promoting better understanding between credit institutions and migrant entrepreneurs through financial literacy programmes. Finally, governments could help immigrants get better access to finance by creating and supporting alternative funding sources outside regular financial channels.</div>
