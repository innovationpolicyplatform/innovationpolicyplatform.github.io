Firms shape, express and fuel their technological needs by engaging in the innovative process via various channels and business models, while their technological choices are to a degree determined by the existing dynamics of technological and economic development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology transfer forms a path of using and exploiting existing and new knowledge for product development and commercial purposes. As such stock is distributed in different loci, the demand for its use and commercialization rests upon the existence of access channels and transfer mechanisms, barriers and transaction costs. Then the interactions between key technology transfer actors rests at the core of unlocking the potential of such stock and determines the nature and intensity of its transfer.&nbsp;</p></div>

R&amp;D intensive firms are likely to seek complementary sources outside their premises and are the ones who may lead collaborative research projects with other private and public entities. Such ability and strategic orientation increases the likelihood of interaction with universities and PRIs, thus fuels technology transfer and commercialization. The absence of private interest and R&amp;D investment translates into the lack of a sound base of innovative firms and consequently limited demand for the outputs of scientific demand. Such condition would compromise the technology transfer process as it renders some of its attributes (e.g. R&amp;D collaboration licensing) less relevant. </p>

The type and patterns of specialization in an economy influence the results of research and consequently determine the structure and scope of the scientific base available for further use and commercialization. In addition it affects the role and relative power of the key players in the process, such as universities and PRIs, so that it carries implications for the interactions among actors and the relevance of technology transfer activity. For instance, strengthening high-tech industries would intensify R&amp;D collaboration, while an emphasis on more low-tech industries may increase the relevance of extension and consulting services. </p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Considering the importance of the existing and newly produced knowledge base for technology transfer, the temporal dynamics and trajectories of technological development become determining factors for the direction of demand for technology transfer. Whether technological paths evolve smoothly or with discontinuities is a factor that affects technological choices and consequently the demand for existing of new scientific results. In this vein, technological discontinuities can render some existing knowledge obsolete, while technological discoveries along a more tranquil trajectory may spur new clusters of innovations and increase the volume of business opportunities. In both cases, firms have an incentive or “obligation” to explore new alternatives and make use of the technology transfer mechanism. The path dependent nature of knowledge accumulation and technological evolution, can also affect negatively technology transfer and commercialization by locking agents in existing paths, where incrementalism prevails and actors are discouraged to seek / exploit alternatives, hence reducing their interest in technology transfer. </p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Technology transfer, particularly technology commercialization, does not flow naturally from the research base to industries and markets. In principle, well-functioning “markets for ideas and technologies” constitute an appealing mechanism in which inventors, researchers and scientists supply their inventions, and firms, entrepreneurs, and investors demand them, with a price that clears the market. While recognizing that such markets remain incomplete due to the inherent characteristics of knowledge and its applications, their complete absence would limit the opportunities for technology transfer and commercialization. In such setting, uncertainty on the commercial value of scientific discovery would prevail, incentives to launch new ventures would be hampered and processes such as licensing and sales would become hard to execute and control. </p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Open innovation assumes that companies should use external ideas as well as internal ideas to advance their technologies and products. In a world of widely distributed knowledge, companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research, but should also buy or license processes or intellectual property from external sources. Open innovation strategies demand that firms combine internal and external knowledge to create new products and follow internal and external paths to commercialize them. Thus, the adoption of such strategies, clearly points to the use and commercialization of knowledge produced and located outside the firm, including publicly produced knowledge. The implementation of open innovation strategies by firms widens the scope for technology transfer and commercialization and improves the communication and objective sharing between private firms and public research organizations.</p>
