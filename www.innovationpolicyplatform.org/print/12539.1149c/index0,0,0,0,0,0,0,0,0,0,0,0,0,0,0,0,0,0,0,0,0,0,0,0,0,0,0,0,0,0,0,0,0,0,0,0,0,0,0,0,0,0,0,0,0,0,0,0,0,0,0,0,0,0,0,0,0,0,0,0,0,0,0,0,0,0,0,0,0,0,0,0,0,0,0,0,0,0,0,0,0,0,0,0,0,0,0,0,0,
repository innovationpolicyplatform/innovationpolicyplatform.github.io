Patent rights play an especially significant role in technological innovation. The breadth and length of patent scope determine the usefulness of the patent system to inventors—the broader the scope, the more inventions will be patentable—and for social returns. The possibility of obtaining a patent right, which grants exclusivity on the invention, serves as an incentive for inventors to invest in research and development, in part because knowledge can be considered a public good, which usually implies non-rivalry and non-excludability (see <a href="../../content/economics-knowledge/index-3.html?topic-filters=8806" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Economics of knowledge</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>). These factors explain why in the absence of IP rights inventors might not have the opportunity to appropriate all of the social return from their inventions.</div>
