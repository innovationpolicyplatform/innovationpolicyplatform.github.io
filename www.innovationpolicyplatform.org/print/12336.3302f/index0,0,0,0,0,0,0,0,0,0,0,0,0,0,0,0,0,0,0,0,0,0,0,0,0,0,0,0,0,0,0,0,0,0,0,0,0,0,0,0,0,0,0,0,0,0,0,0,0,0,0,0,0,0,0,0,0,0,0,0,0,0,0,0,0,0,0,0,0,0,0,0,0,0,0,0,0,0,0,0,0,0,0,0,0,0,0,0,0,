There is evidence to suggest that lower costs in hiring and firing can facilitate the creation and growth of companies, and have a lesser impact on direct productivity gains. The costs of hiring/firing differ across OECD countries, notably because of differences in employment protection legislation and regulations regarding minimum wages. The costs of hiring and firing can critically affect access to skilled labour, including from abroad. It helps shape the administrative framework for entry and growth, and can therefore impact competition. Policies can influence the costs of hiring/firing in relation to innovative businesses in several ways, such as supporting workers rather than jobs and ensuring that employment legislation is as clear and simple as possible.</p>

EPL imposes extra costs when work contracts are terminated early and generally limits the situations in which dismissals are allowed.

<div class="field field-name-field-paragraph-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden">
    <div class="field-items">
          <div class="field-item even"><h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impacts on firms’ growth</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Hiring and firing costs can influence innovative firms by affecting investment and expansion. For example, onerous regulations preventing the employment of foreign workers can make it difficult to recruit skilled people. As the size of a business increases, the costs of hiring and firing may inhibit the firm from expanding further. Changing, unclear and complex regulation can discourage companies from hiring new employees.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Investment and risk-taking</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">High costs in firing are likely to affect a company’s willingness to take risks and experiment with growth opportunities. In fact, firms may be less willing to expand their workforces and to enter into new markets if they cannot shrink their workforces when their strategies prove unsuccessful. An aversion to risk taking leads to more conservative growth strategies, which reduces productivity. This can be particularly detrimental for innovative industries, which tend to be more risky and volatile. As a consequence, countries with greater worker protection and thus higher firing costs may specialize in industries that are less innovative or that rely on older technologies, since more dynamic industries have to be prepared to adjust their workforce (Samaniego, 2006). Also, innovators in countries with high firing costs may tend to specialize in “secondary innovation” that improves existing products, rather than “primary innovation” that introduces new products (Saint-Paul, 2000) and requires organizational change. Furthermore, high firing costs may create additional&nbsp;<strong>sunk costs</strong>, i.e. upfront costs incurred that cannot be recovered ex post, for emerging firms; redundancy pay, for instance, increases the risk of economic losses in the event of insolvency (Kanniainen and Vesala, 2005).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Job turnover and reallocation dynamics</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Stringent labour market regulations and high firing costs may prevent an efficient reallocation of human resources and reduce job turnover across firms. Therefore, strict EPL may be an obstacle to&nbsp;<strong>creative destruction</strong>, an important process through which countries create new jobs and increase their productivity (OECD, 2009; Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta, 2009; Bravo-Biosca, Criscuolo and Menon, 2013). Creative destruction, if it is to have a positive effect, depends on reallocating and redistributing those resources that are destroyed.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Arguments as to why hiring/firing costs are not necessarily detrimental to innovative firms</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The negative link between innovation and EPL is controversial. Firms that invest significantly in training and share tacit knowledge may benefit from stringent EPL, as they can take advantage of lower rates of labour turnover and increase their return on investment (Acharya et al., 2010); similarly, stringent EPL, acting as an implicit insurance, may encourage workers to be more willing to engage in innovative and risky projects. Furthermore, efficiency wage theories suggest that workers may perceive EPL as an upgrade in the quality of their employment, which may lead them to increase their efforts and have a positive effect on innovation.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The empirical evidence on the effects of hiring and firing costs on successful innovative firms</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-size: 13.008px; line-height: 1.538em;">There is a general consensus in the economic literature about the negative effects of EPL on job reallocation</strong>, with evidence available both within and across countries (Bertola, 1990; Haltiwanger et al., 2006; Gomez-Salvador et al., 2004; Kugler and Pica, 2008).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Direct effects on firms’ productivity</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The direct effect on firms’ performance is more debatable. Bassanini et al. (2009) find that mandatory dismissal regulations have a depressing impact on productivity growth in industries where layoff restrictions are more likely to be binding. However, Martin and Scarpetta (2012) extensively examine recent empirical evidence to conclude that stringent EPL has a sizeable negative effect on labour flows and, in consequence, on aggregate productivity growth.</div></div>

<div style="text-align:justify">The OECD publishes data on minimum wages, such as annual data on real hourly minimum wages, i.e. statutory minimum wages converted into a common hourly pay period for the 26 countries for which they are available (Figure 1). Countries such as Luxembourg, France, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland exhibit the highest hourly minimum wages, while Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Chile and Estonia have the lowest hourly minimum wages among OECD countries.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><span>Real hourly minimum wages are statutory minimum wages converted into a common hourly pay period for the 26 countries for which they are available. The resulting estimates are deflated by national Consumer Price Indices (CPI). The data are then converted into a common currency unit using either US $ current exchange rates or US $ Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) for private consumption expenditures. Real hourly minimum wages are calculated first by deflating the series using the consumer price index and taking 2011 as the base year. The series are then converted into a common currency unit (USD), using Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) for private consumption expenditures in 2011.</span><br /><span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Source:</span> data extracted from OECD.Stat</span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<h5 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Indicators to assess costs of hiring and firing</strong></h5>
<div style="text-align:justify">The OECD employment protection indicators cover three different aspects of employment protection:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify">
<ul><li><strong>Individual dismissal of workers with regular contracts.</strong> This incorporates three aspects of dismissal protection:</li>
</ul><div style="text-align:justify; padding-left:60px">(i) procedural inconveniences that employers face when starting the dismissal process;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify; padding-left:60px">(ii) notice periods and severance pay;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify; padding-left:60px">(iii) difficulty of dismissal, as determined by the circumstances in which it is possible to dismiss workers, as well as the repercussions for the employer if a dismissal is found to be unfair (such as compensation and reinstatement).</div>
<ul><li><strong>Additional costs for collective dismissals.</strong> Most countries impose additional delays, costs or notification procedures when an employer dismisses a large number of workers at one time. </li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Regulation of temporary contracts.</strong> This quantifies regulation of fixed-term and temporary work agency contracts with respect to the types of work for which these contracts are allowed and their duration. This also quantifies regulation governing the establishment and operation of temporary work agencies, and requirements for agency workers to receive the same pay and/or conditions as equivalent workers in the user firm, which can increase the cost of using temporary workers relative to permanent employees.</li>
</ul></div>
<div style="text-align:justify"><br />Based on these indicators, the strictness of EPL varies widely across OECD member countries (Figure 2). The degree of variation is even larger when the different sub-components of EPL (e.g. regulation of temporary contracts or of collective dismissals) are examined individually.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify">The World Bank Doing Business annual reports contain a section on employing workers, which includes a number of sub-components on firing costs, along with other indicators such as indicators on difficulty of hiring, difficulty of firing. Results indicate that governments in high-income OECD economies focused on reducing redundancy costs in the past decade: 15 labour regulation reforms introduced by high-income OECD economies in the past 8 years either reduced the severance pay in cases of redundancy dismissal or shortened the required notice period for employees. In 2013, the average severance payment in high-income OECD economies is 5.83 weeks of salary (World Bank, 2013).</div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>Labour market policies targeting workers rather than jobs</strong> can be valuable.

<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
