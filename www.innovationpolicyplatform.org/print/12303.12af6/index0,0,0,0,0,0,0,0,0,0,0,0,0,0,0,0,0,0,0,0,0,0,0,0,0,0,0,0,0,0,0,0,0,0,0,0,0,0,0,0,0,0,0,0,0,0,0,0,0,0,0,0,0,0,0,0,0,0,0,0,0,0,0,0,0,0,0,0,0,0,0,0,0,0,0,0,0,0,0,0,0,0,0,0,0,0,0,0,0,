<div> </div>
<div>Financing is often unavailable for the additional research needed to develop a proof of concept, prototype, or patent. These activities are neither eligible for standard research grants nor attractive options for venture capitalists, constituting a segment of the research commercialization process often called “the valley of death”. At this stage, innovative young firms are at too early a stage of development to pull in venture capital investors and too risky and lacking tangible assets to receive traditional bank loans. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The existence of this gap limits the possibility to turn research results into commercially viable products and services, while private investments remain low due to the high technological uncertainty and management difficulties. Such conditions require governments and, increasingly, individual institutions to provide alleviate such funding gap.</div>
<div>This can be achieved through the combination of instruments that (i) stimulate the demand for new technologies, i.e. innovation procurement schemes, (ii) supply firms the necessary credit to fuel the R&amp;D process and (iii) provide advisory and technical services for bridging the gap between exploring a new concept and developing a product or service. </div>
