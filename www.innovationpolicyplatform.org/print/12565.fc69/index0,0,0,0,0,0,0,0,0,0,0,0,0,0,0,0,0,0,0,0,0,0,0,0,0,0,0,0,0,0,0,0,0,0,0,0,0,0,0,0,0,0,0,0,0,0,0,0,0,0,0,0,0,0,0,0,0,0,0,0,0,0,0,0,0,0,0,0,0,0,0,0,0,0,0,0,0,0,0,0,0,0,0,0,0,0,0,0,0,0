Qualitative methods, especially those assessing the burdens of regulation, should complement quantitative methods, to better target these efforts.</li>
</ul><ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Introducing special procedural measures to assess the impact of new regulation on early stage firms and small businesses. This includes, for example, requiring agencies to prepare special impact statements for proposed regulations that affect small businesses.

</ul><ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Considering implementation approaches that limit the burden for smaller businesses. This includes: exemptions to some regulations for the smallest businesses, combining regulations to minimize the number of inspections and forms, instituting a system of “presumed consent” (i.e. that a business is assumed to have registered/complied with a regulation if the relevant authority does not object in a certain time, and that lack of response can be interpreted as assent), and seeking to have consistent approaches and times for processing particular procedures (since uncertainty can be more damaging than the actual length of a procedure).</li>
