          <div class="field-item even"><div style="text-align:justify">International linkages are critical for innovation because they provide powerful learning opportunities and support innovation processes (e.g. through the acquisition of machinery and technology licensing from abroad) (see <a href="http://innovationpolicyplatform.org/content/what-sorts-linkages-can-foster-innovation?topic-filters=12071" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linkages for innovation</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>). By pooling competencies (e.g. through technological cooperation between firms – see <a href="../../content/technological-co-operation-between-firms/index-2.html?topic-filters=12057" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Technological co-operation between firms</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>), international linkages can allow overcoming barriers such as deficiencies in funding, management resources and technological competencies (Innovation Networks and Clusters for details - see <a href="../../content/innovation-networks-and-clusters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Innovation Networks and Clusters</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>). International linkages can also benefit innovative businesses through technology and knowledge transfer, skills enhancement, and facilitating access to foreign markets. (See <a href="http://innovationpolicyplatform.org/content/technology-transfer-and-commercialization?topic-filters=11388" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Technology Transfer and Commercialisation</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span>.)</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify">These linkages are increasingly important as research is more and more globalized (see <a href="../../patent-data-globalisation-research/index.html?topic-filters=8631" target="_blank">Patent data - Globalisation of research</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>). Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have expanded their R&amp;D and innovation activities across the world (see <a href="../../content/multinational-enterprises-mnes/index-2.html?topic-filters=8691" target="_blank">Multinational enterprises (MNEs)</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span>). At the same time, R&amp;D linkages have grown steadily in recent years. The geographical pattern of international linkages has also evolved in recent years as new global players have emerged (see <a href="../../content/patent-data-geography-invention/index-3.html?topic-filters=8769" target="_blank">Patent data - The geography of invention</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>, and <a href="../../content/new-context-innovation/index-2.html?topic-filters=8622" target="_blank">A new context for innovation</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span>).</div>

          <div class="field-item even"><div style="text-align:justify">Key policy dimensions to be taken into consideration by policy makers to support international linkages include the following:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"> </div>
<div style="text-align:justify">
<ul><li><strong>Education and skills.</strong> Domestic firms must have the capacity to absorb and draw profits from knowledge spillover. This might be facilitated by fostering relevant skills development; exchanges of students, scientists and engineers; as well as by migrants, who can profit from contacts in their country of origin and from an understanding of its culture and markets (see <a href="../../content/international-rd-linkages-universities-and-pris/index-2.html?topic-filters=8623" target="_blank">International R&amp;D linkages of universities and PRIs</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span>)</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Access to finance.</strong> Obstacles to access to finance may prevent innovative domestic businesses from collaborating with organizations located abroad; expanding internationally; implementing what they have learned from foreign companies, products and markets; and implementing foreign technologies.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Regulation and standards</strong>. International standards support the diffusion of innovation across borders by setting common rules, facilitating the interoperability between products, reducing risks for producers and consumers, and diminishing transactions costs. Harmonizing national procedures through international treaties and agreements is also important to foster international linkages, as differences in regulation and duplication of regulatory procedures among trading partners are potential impediments to trade. Effective international intellectual property rights systems (see <a href="../../content/international-dimensions-ip-systems/index-2.html?topic-filters=8828" target="_blank">International dimensions of IP systems</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span>), including international bodies on IP (see <a href="../../content/international-bodies-ip/index-2.html?topic-filters=8827" target="_blank">International bodies on IP</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span>) and international agreements on IP (see <a href="../../content/international-agreements-ip/index-2.html?topic-filters=8883" target="_blank">International agreements on IP</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span>) are also essential to promote international linkages in the context of innovation (e.g. by ensuring the protection for patents, trademarks, and designs worldwide; by simplifying IP transactions across borders; and by facilitating the resolution of IP disputes), international competitiveness and trade (see<a href="../../content/ip-and-international-competitiveness-and-trade/index-2.html?topic-filters=8845" target="_blank"> IP and international competitiveness and trade</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span>). </li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Access to foreign and domestic markets</strong> (see <a href="../../content/access-foreign-and-domestic-markets/index-3.html?topic-filters=8782" target="_blank">Access to foreign and domestic markets</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span>). Tariff and non-tariff barriers (e.g. quotas, administrative entry procedures) and other legal conditions that limit or encourage foreign firms’ entry may affect foreign direct investments (FDI) and international trade. </li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Migration</strong> (see <a href="../../content/migration/index-2.html?topic-filters=12155" target="_blank">Migration</a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span>). Migrants can stimulate international linkages including transfer of knowledge across countries and research collaborations between their host country and country of origin, due to their contacts and understanding of both cultures and markets.</li>
